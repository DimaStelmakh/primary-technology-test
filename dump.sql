<p>WordPress 4.4 is slated for release on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-4-project-schedule/" target="_blank">December 8</a>, but to get there, we need your help testing what we have been working on, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twenty Sixteen </strong>— The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/">newest</a> default theme for WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Images </strong>— WordPress automatically delivers a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/responsive-images-merge-proposal/">more appropriate image</a> to users depending on a variety of conditions like screen size, viewport size, and screen resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Embeds </strong>— WordPress can now embed rich content from nearly all sites that support the oEmbed standard — not just YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, and the like. You can even embed <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">plugin</a> has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">included in WordPress 4.4</a>. Plugin authors can take advantage of this by adding custom endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Term Metadata </strong>— Taxonomy term metadata is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/04/taxonomy-term-metadata-proposal/">now included</a> in WordPress 4.4. If you&#8217;ve already been using a plugin to implement term metadata, you should read <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">this post</a> on how to prepare. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162">#14162</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Comment</code> class improves caching and introduces strong-typing. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8071">#8071</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32619">#32619</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta" target="_blank">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/" target="_blank">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>.

<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'video\');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

Since 3.0&#8217;s release on November 18th, the development team <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/changelog/">has released </a>six point releases.</p>
<p>Joost de Valk, founder of <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast.com</a>, and lead developer of WordPress SEO, <a href="https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-3-0-release-a-recap/">explains</a> the mistakes made with the release and apologizes for the lack of communication, &#8220;We’ve made mistakes, obviously. Of course, there were bugs, which we have worked hard on and are still working on right now. We’ve made mistakes in communication too. We’re sorry about that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO</a> is active on more than a million sites and the fallout from issues experienced by users upgrading to the 3.0 branch has resulted in <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/wordpress-seo?filter=1">many negative reviews</a>. Over time, the plugin has <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/too-many-updates-instead-of-one-stable-release#post-">gained a reputation</a> of breaking with each upgrade.</p>
<h2>More Beta Testers Needed</h2>
<p>de Valk admits that when 3.0 was pushed out to the public, users would encounter bugs, but says it&#8217;s part of having a large variety of configurations across their install base, &#8220;There were a few bugs that I think we should’ve caught in our testing period which was extensive and we’re taking precautions to make sure we do next time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://yoast.com/dev-blog/road-to-yoast-seo-3-0/">roadmap to Yoast SEO 3.0</a> published in November, the amount of people who tested the releases was small compared to every day users. The team is asking for ideas on how to encourage more people to participate in the beta testing process.</p>
<h2>Communication Breakdown</h2>
<p>de Valk and his team of five actively responded to users on Twitter and email but didn&#8217;t immediately address users on Facebook which led to harsh criticism. Paying customers were prioritized while free users were told that they wouldn&#8217;t be supported over email.</p>
<p>de Valk admits it was probably the wrong course of action, &#8220;This was probably, in hindsight, not what we should’ve done. For future major releases we will try to actively support <em>everybody</em> for a period of time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>It’s Difficult to Change a Reputation</h2>
<p>He also addresses the usability issues caused by changes to the user interface of the snippet editor, &#8220;We thought the interface was intuitive, we also thought people would watch that (30 second) video, but we were obviously wrong. We’re now thinking about how to improve the snippet editor so it’s more obvious <em>how</em> you are able to edit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The issues experienced by people upgrading WordPress SEO is a good example as to why automatically updating plugins is a bad idea. While the team continues to work hard to fix issues in the 3.0 branch, it&#8217;s going to take a number of excellent releases to erode the negative reputation that WordPress SEO upgrades will either break functionality or the site that&#8217;s using it.</p>

<p>Feldman and his team of four, created the service after speaking to more than 100 plugin developers and realizing there&#8217;s a huge gap between what WordPress authors have in terms of data, compared to what web and mobile products have in the market.</p>
<h2>Up Front Opt-in</h2>
<p>According to the WordPress <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">plugin directory guidelines</a>, plugins are not allowed to phone home. That is, secretly send data without the user&#8217;s consent. Freemius Insights provides an opt-in form that displays immediately after activating a plugin. If a user skips this step, data won&#8217;t be sent to the author and the user is forwarded to the plugin&#8217;s settings screen.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsopt-in.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49240"><img class="size-full wp-image-49240" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsopt-in.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="Freemius Insights Ope-in" /></a>Freemius Insights Opt-in
<p>The opt-in form is compatible with the plugin directory&#8217;s guidelines and is an easy way to be <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-authors-be-up-front-and-honest-with-users-about-tracking">up front and honest</a> with users that data is sent to a third-party.</p>
<h2>Data Collected by Freemius Insights</h2>
<p>If a user clicks the allow and continue button in the opt-in form, the following data is collected by Freemius Insights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Sites</li>
<li>Users</li>
<li>How many users are connected to Freemius</li>
<li>How many users deactivated the plugin</li>
<li>How many users uninstalled the plugin</li>
<li>Plugin versions</li>
<li>WordPress versions</li>
<li>PHP versions</li>
<li>Reasons for uninstalling</li>
<li>Top 10 languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers can use the Insights dashboard to see compiled data at a glance.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsstats.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49241"><img class="size-full wp-image-49241" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsstats.png?resize=1025%2C742" alt="Freemium Insights Stats Dashboard" /></a>Freemium Insights Stats Dashboard
<p>This type of information helps developers make critical decisions such as what new features to work on, backwards compatibility, what translations to focus on, and more.</p>
<h2>See Which Sites Are Using Your Plugins</h2>
<p>In addition to these stats, developers can see which domains the plugin is activated on. Knowing the sites a plugin is activated on is valuable data. For example, if a plugin is used on Microsoft.com, the developer can leverage that information to possibly establish a one to one relationship. <span class="_5yl5">Developers can also create up sells to those specific sites.</span></p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightssites.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49242"><img class="size-full wp-image-49242" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightssites.png?resize=1025%2C709" alt="Sites the Plugin is Activated On" /></a>Sites the Plugin is Activated On
<p><span class="_5yl5">Freemius Insights also uses this data to automatically send an email if a user uninstalls the plugin within the first hour after installation. The email template is personalized with the user&#8217;s name and site address. It asks for feedback on how the plugin can be improved or why it didn&#8217;t meet their needs.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Developers can even dive deep into a site&#8217;s activity and view recent events associated with their plugin such as updates, installs, activation, and who initiated the action. You can see the site&#8217;s language, PHP version, and a variety of other data.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightssite.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49243"><img class="size-full wp-image-49243" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightssite.png?resize=1025%2C917" alt="Detailed Site View" /></a>Detailed Site View
<p>If you want to know the names of the people who opted in, you can see that too. Since Freemius Insights collects a user&#8217;s email address, developers can interact with users on an individual level instead of broadcasting emails.</p>

<h2>Receiving Feedback at a Critical Time</h2>
<p>One of the most annoying things plugin developers face are one star reviews with no explanation behind the review. Based on data collected during the beta testing process, Feldman discovered that more than 20% of the users who install a plugin will uninstall it within the first 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Freemius Insights has a Deactivation Feedback Form. This form appears when a user deactivates the plugin and gives users an opportunity to explain why they deactivated it.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsdeactivation-form.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49245"><img class="size-full wp-image-49245" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsdeactivation-form.png?resize=1025%2C759" alt="Deactivation Form" /></a>Deactivation Form
<p>This could be annoying if you&#8217;re deactivating a plugin to troubleshoot WordPress but Feldman explains why the form is tied to the deactivation procedure, &#8220;O<span class="_5yl5">nce the user deactivates the plugin, the plugin can&#8217;t modify anything in the dashboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="_5yl5">The data is not sent until the plugin is deleted. If the user provides feedback, it&#8217;s stored locally in the database. When a user proceeds with the deletion process, it fires the uninstall hook and sends the data to the server,&#8221; he said.<br />
</span></p>
<h2>Reasons Why Users Uninstall a Plugin</h2>
<p>In general, people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias">give negative</a> feedback more than positive. During the beta testing period, Freemius Insights witnessed more than a 82% conversion rate with the feedback form. This data is invaluable to developers and can be viewed on the Insights dashboard.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsDetailedStats.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49247"><img class="size-full wp-image-49247" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsDetailedStats.png?resize=385%2C197" alt="Reasons Why Users Deactivated The Plugin" /></a>Reasons Why Users Deactivated The Plugin
<p>Although Other is not helpful in this chart, it&#8217;s valuable because it represents how many users chose to provide custom feedback. It reinforces the fact that users are more than willing to tell developers what&#8217;s wrong if given the opportunity. Developers can also filter sites by Uninstalls to get a deeper understanding as to why a specific user uninstalled the plugin.</p>
<h2>Webhooks for Developers</h2>
<p>Freemius Insights has a webhooks mechanism built-in that enables developers to forward events to another location. For example, when a user installs a plugin, the developer can push the user&#8217;s email address into MailChimp. Another example is when a user upgrades a plugin, you can send them an email that lists new features in that version.</p>
<h2>Free and Paid Subscription Plans</h2>
<p>Freemius Insights has a free plan available to developers of free plugins. The free plan includes an unlimited amount of team members and captured users, but no email export. Paid plans start at $29.99 a month up to $299.99 a month depending on your install base.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsPricingChart.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49253"><img class="size-full wp-image-49253" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsPricingChart.png?resize=1025%2C636" alt="Freemium Insights Pricing Chart" /></a>Freemium Insights Pricing Chart
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in connecting your plugin to Freemius Insights, you&#8217;ll need to request a <a href="http://freemius.com/wordpress/insights/#demo_form">hands-on demo</a> with the team. Feldman explains the benefits of a hands-on approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to be in control of our scale. Analytics requires a significant amount of storage and performance. If one of the most popular plugins joins the service without a heads up, it might drain our server&#8217;s resources and affect the performance of the rest of our users.</li>
<li>FTUE (first-time user experience) is crucial for every service. Signing into an empty dashboard might make the wrong impression, and we know the first impression is critical. Therefore, we prefer to demo the platform by showing real data from our plugin.</li>
<li>We believe the personal touch is more than a cliché. We are willing to spend time getting to know each developer we work with, building a personal relationship, and making sure every integration is a success story. We also love to learn new things, and user feedback is extremely valuable to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feldman says Insights is for plugin developers who want to make data driven decisions, &#8220;Freemius Insights provides ad-hoc data so developers don&#8217;t have to base decisions on gut instinct.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Out of Beta</h2>
<p>Freemius Insights is out of beta and today marks the first opportunity the public has to see Insights in action.

<p>Last week Matt Mullenweg, CEO of <a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a> and co-creator of WordPress, joined Robert Scoble, John Borthwick, and Steve Gillmor to discuss Calypso on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/28/gillmor-gang-more-gravy/" target="_blank">an episode of the Gillmor Gang</a>. The video was recorded Tuesday, November 24 and published over the weekend.</p>
<p>Mullenweg offers a hands-on tour of the new reader, notifications, and editor and explains WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture for audience members who are not development-oriented. He also explains how the desktop client and browser version were developed simultaneously so that WordPress.com can continue to iterate just as quickly as it has in the past, with developers committing new code 140+ times per day.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t get enough of WordPress vs. Medium comparisons, then this episode is for you. When asked if he sees Medium as a competitor to WordPress, Mullenweg replied, &#8220;In some ways we compete with every place that people publish online, even Twitter or Facebook, but in day to day, that competition doesn&#8217;t really drive product decisions and for most people what we provide is pretty distinct from what these other platforms have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the episode Mullenweg is asked, &#8220;What are the holes still left unfilled in publishing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Publishing is still so mediocre,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Some of the best stuff Medium did is around their editor. I think the whole writing/collaboration experience can be significantly better than it is today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mullenweg elaborates on the differences between WordPress.com and Medium&#8217;s user base and his vision for where Automattic will take Calypso in the future. Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t embed the episode here, but you can <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/28/gillmor-gang-more-gravy/" target="_blank">check it out on TechCrunch</a>.</p>

One of the event&#8217;s highlights is Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s State of the Word presentation. In it, Mullenweg shares data on WordPress&#8217; growth throughout the year and gives insight to where the project is heading.</p>
<p>About a week before his presentation, Mullenweg asks members of the WordPress community for feedback. Questions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the things you&#8217;re most proud of WordPress or people in the community doing over the past year?</li>
<li>Have there been people who you feel have influenced the project in a big way, including yourself, and how?</li>
<li>What do you think we should focus on and work on the most in the next year?</li>
<li>Any stories you&#8217;ve heard with or around WordPress that you think deserve being highlighted?</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ol>
<p>This year, the most important question he asks is number five. Each year during the State of the Word, Mullenweg highlights new and existing contributors and we as a community cheer and celebrate them. This year, we&#8217;ve lost some incredibly talented and important people in the community.</p>
<p>I suggest that Mullenweg adds one slide to his presentation that remembers the lives of those lost in the community this year. The slide should have Gravatars or photos and the names of those who passed away. Here are a few people who would be on the slide.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away">Kim Parsell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/alex-king-founder-of-crowd-favorite-passes-away">Alex King</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mattreport.com/honoring-clint-warren/">Clint Warren</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/wordcampmiami/status/561953493360336896">Jacqueline Jiminez</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re in favor of this idea and know someone in the WordPress community who passed away this year, please leave a comment with their name and if possible, a link to their obituary.</p>
<p>WordPress is a 12-year-old open source software project that will likely survive long after the people who help maintain it pass on. Adding a slide to the State of the Word that remembers contributors who passed away during the year is a small price to pay. It also humanizes the software and serves as a reminder that without contributors, WordPress wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac" target="_blank">Automattic unveiled Project Calypso</a>, a brand new architecture for WordPress.com and a <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mac app</a> that mirrors the experience on desktop. The overhaul was nearly two years in the making, a risky bet for Automattic but one that shows a glimpse of what the future of WordPress could be.</p>
<p>The new JavaScript and REST API-powered WordPress.com technologically pivots the platform into a lithe modern publishing engine while shedding 10 years of legacy code in the process. It&#8217;s easy to see why Calypso has so far received <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/calypso-24-hours-later/" target="_blank">glowing reviews</a> from news outlets around the web. The <a href="https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/whats-new-wpcom2.pdf" target="_blank">giant technological leap forward</a> results in a publishing experience that is a night-and-day difference when it comes to page loads, content previewing, and real-time updating.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/24/wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg-breaks-down-the-blogging-platforms-biggest-overhaul-in-years/" target="_blank">interview with VentureBeat</a>, Matt Mullenweg answers a burning question that the community wants to know &#8211; <em>What does Calypso mean for WordPress core?</em> Will core adopt a similar technology stack? Mullenweg sees Calypso as just one example of what is possible with WordPress.</p>
<blockquote><p>So I think what might happen is that the technology that drives the server side of WordPress and what drives the client side can diverge. Again, this is really up to the community, so we’ll see where it takes us. This thing we released has only been out there one day. Maybe someone will make something much better?</p></blockquote>
<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture isn&#8217;t the first case of &#8220;headless WordPress,&#8221; though it is one of the most prominent and easiest examples for users to demo. Many other WordPress-powered sites have already adopted an approach that decouples the interface using the new WP REST API. Apps like <a href="https://storycorps.me/" target="_blank">StoryCorps</a>, <a href="http://nomadbase.io/" target="_blank">Nomadbase</a>, the New York Times, and the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/apple-liveblog-iphone-apple-tv-news/" target="_blank">Wired.com liveblog</a> are a few early pioneers using the API to deliver content.</p>
<p>Another example offered in the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-story-behind-the-new-wordpress-com/#comment-7275" target="_blank">comments</a> on the WordPress.com developer blog cites <a href="https://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">ustwo.com</a> (the makers of Monument Valley, Dice, and other popular apps) as using a similar setup. The site is a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React.js</a> single-page application that serves WordPress content via the WP REST API using custom endpoints. Like WordPress.com, the code for this site is also <a href="https://github.com/ustwo/ustwo.com-frontend" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the risk of sharing the large innovative codebase with competitors, Automattic opted to keep Calypso open and available for anyone in the WordPress community to learn from and build upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I’ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back,&#8221; Mullenweg said in his <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Within the first 24 hours the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso" target="_blank">repo</a> was already <a href="https://github.com/trending" target="_blank">trending on GitHub</a>, with developers eagerly reviewing the code. ManageWP, a competitor to Jetpack Manage, <a href="https://managewp.com/will-calypso-change-game" target="_blank">praised Calypso</a> as an important tool to help drive up WordPress marketshare and move the platform forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s the beauty of WordPress – the Foundation is not looking to put us under Automattic’s thumb; Matt and his team are actively encouraging the WordPress community, through open source policy, to keep building, innovating, making lives easier for everyone, and find their own place in the ecosystem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Automattic&#8217;s commitment to open sourcing its code demonstrates that any innovations they release are not designed to eclipse competitors&#8217; efforts but rather to add to the shared knowledge bank that drives WordPress improvements.</p>
<p>Mullenweg, in a <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/calypso-24-hours-later/" target="_blank">roundup of press on Calypso</a>, brings it back to the core value of democratizing publishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, it’s not about technology for technology’s sake, it’s about technology at the service of human voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Embracing change to support the free, open web where everyone has a voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calypso is one of the best new examples of having WordPress your way. It demonstrates the flexibility of using a REST API to run any kind of JavaScript application on top of WordPress while maintaining the use of its world class CMS features. Greater architectural freedom for developers means more compelling publishing experiences for users. The success of the open source Calypso project will likely pave the way for many more JavaScript and REST API-powered WordPress sites and desktop applications.</p>

Lema shares his experience beta testing a Windows version of Automattic&#8217;s new desktop application. We discuss how WordPress is going to grow its market share from 25% to 50% and how important Jetpack is to reaching that goal. Near the end of the interview, Lema shares what he&#8217;s most thankful for as it relates to WordPress.</p>

<h2>Plugins Picked By Marcus:</h2>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-tao/">WP TAO</a> by Michal Jaworski and Damian Gora from Poland, is a free powerful WordPress plugin for tracking website visitors. It allows you to identify your users and keep track of their activities in an easy to read digital dashboard and log format.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cool-timeline/">Cool Timeline</a> is Narinder Singh&#8217;s first plugin in the repository. It creates responsive, vertical story lines in chronological order based on the year and date of your posts.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-force/">The Force</a> created by Rohit Motwani from India, is a Hello Dolly clone that when activated, replaces music lyrics with random quotes from Star Wars characters.</p>
<h2>What I&#8217;m Thankful For:</h2>
<p>This has been a rough year for me. I’m struggling with my health and maintaining a schedule as a distributed worker. A dear WordPress friend of mine (Kim Parsell) passed away at the beginning of the year. My grandma was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and I’ve been dealing with wild swings between feeling positive and downright depressed.</p>
<p>The thing I’m most thankful for this year as it relates to WordPress are the people who make up the community. Some are personal friends, others live on the other side of the world. Their consistent reinforcement of positive vibes has helped me get through some turbulent times in my life this year. To everyone who has and continues to give me encouragement, advice, and positive reinforcement, thank you.</p>
<h2>What Marcus is Thankful For:</h2>
<p>This year was one of the hardest years for me in terms of professional struggles and hardships. I lost relatives and friends, a job, and had to start from square one. I had a lot of support from within the WordPress community coming really close to working with a few people directly. In the end, it was my WordPress skills that landed me a new gig, which I now call <em>The Dream Gig</em>.</p>
<p>I’m thankful for the opportunities to meet people from within the WordPress community in real life. From Chris Lema and Cory Miller to Jeff Chandler and beyond. Every time I meet someone, they not only share their successes, but their struggles. It’s good to know that I’m not the only one and be able to use their strength and perseverance to fuel my drive and passion for WordPress.</p>
<p>I’m thankful for the opportunity to share what I know to thousands of people around the world. I feel the best sense of accomplishment when I receive an email from someone that&#8217;s stuck on a particular problem and discovers a solution after they hear me talk about a plugin or technique on a podcast. It’s a great outlet for me personally that I hope to continue for many more years to come. Thanks to all who are listening and to those who are listening for the first time.</p>

<h3>Why did you make such a big bet on Calypso?</h3>
<p>Matt has talked for a while now about his vision that WordPress can become an &#8220;app platform,&#8221; and this is an example of what that meant to him.</p>
<p>He also notes how he&#8217;s always  looking for things that will &#8220;move the needle&#8221; for greater WordPress adoption. We were both thinking about the same statistic: that <a href="https://poststatus.com/2013-state-of-the-word-from-matt-mullenweg/">roughly 96% of WordPress.com users</a> (and probably a high number of WordPress.org users too) essentially abandon their websites after a short tenure. So anything that can increase that number, to say 8% or 15% of folks that stick with it long term, can make a huge difference.</p>
<h3>How do you think about investing in feature development for WordPress.com, and how it affects WordPress as well?</h3>
<p>When Matt considers where he wants to invest Automattic developer and designer time, he says he thinks of WordPress as a whole first, before considering specifics for WordPress.com. He&#8217;d rather see WordPress.com as a gateway to a self-hosted install. And whether someone stays on .com or moves to a self-hosted install, he wants to help ensure that their problems are solved.</p>
<h3>WordPresses</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s new to me, but Matt says he&#8217;s been saying it for years, that he calls WordPress websites &#8220;WordPresses,&#8221; after a long time internal debate about whether to call WordPress.com websites sites or blogs.</p>
<h3>WordPress.com as a network versus a platform</h3>
<p>The new homepage for logged in users, or users in the WordPress.com app, defaults to the Reader view of the interface, versus the writing view. This intrigued me, as I don&#8217;t personally think of WordPress.com as a read-first ecosystem, but rather a place to write. I think more of Tumblr or Medium when I think of a destination for reading, where I may also write.</p>
<p>Matt and I talked about the merits of WordPress as a network versus a platform. He thinks it can be both. And I think this touches on one of the big goals for Calypso that we haven&#8217;t discussed yet: to make WordPress a better network.</p>
<p>To me, WordPress.com is a platform, but WordPress (both .com and Jetpack enabled sites) are ripe to be a hugely successful network, through the huge number of websites and independent publishers that are interconnected via WordPress.com.</p>
<p>There is more evidence that this is a goal for them too, with the <a href="https://discover.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/hello-world/">launch of Discover WordPress</a> along with the release of the new interface. Discover WordPress is a project by the editorial team to surface the best writing across WordPress.com and Jetpack enabled websites.</p>
<p>Furthermore, beyond the human curated content, much could be done in the future algorithmically. We didn&#8217;t get as much into this stuff as I would&#8217;ve liked, but I think it&#8217;s  an enormous growth area for Automattic.</p>
<h3>Open sourcing Calypso</h3>
<p>The Calypso <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso">project code</a> is fully open source, and is a top trending project on Github right now. There are few requirements to run the code locally, so you can pretty quickly get a working web view.</p>
<p>There are a slew of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/components">fancy React components</a> that could be pretty easily lifted from Calypso and used independently, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/guide/hello-world.md">guide to getting started</a> with the full codebase.</p>
<h3>How can the community anticipate the future, with more abstracted implementations of WordPress?</h3>
<p>As WordPress projects continue to use REST APIs to create fully custom frontends, backends, and inbetweens, I was curious what Matt thinks the community can do to anticipate and educate users on how to deal with these scenarios, that may fragment WordPress and be confusing for people who expect WordPress plugins and code to interact well with one another.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much of a problem, but says it&#8217;s important that we experiment and learn from our experiments; he was hesitant to call the potential for confusion fragmentation as much as experimentation. Either way, I do think education and documentation will be important as other folks continue to use parts of WordPress to make impressive things, without supporting every specific thing that can <em>also</em> run on WordPress.</p>
<p>An example of this is the WordPress.com app itself. You can manage Jetpack enabled sites through it, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you get everything in the editor you&#8217;d get with a WordPress.org site, like custom fields and other plugin functionality that the desktop app doesn&#8217;t support.</p>
<h3>What is Automattic&#8217;s differentiating factor?</h3>
<p>I wanted to know what Automattic&#8217;s differentiating factor is, in Matt&#8217;s mind. He defaulted, I guess unsurprisingly, to &#8220;everything,&#8221; but as I pushed him a little further, he dug a bit more into some of the things that make Automattic interesting.</p>
<p>From a self-hosted perspective, WordPress.com integrated tools like Stats, VaultPress, and Akismet are difficult to match with other tools.</p>
<p>For WordPress.com, he thinks the potential power of the Reader and network can be compelling. I agree there that the diversity of the WordPress.com and Jetpack author audience could make for a compelling Reading product, that has more potential than I see right now in a competitor like Medium, which is quite tech heavy.</p>
<p>Matt says, <span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;We&#8217;ve built up a lot of trust in the community, and that goodwill definitely pays back.&#8221;</span> Part of what makes it hard to identify Automattic&#8217;s specific differentiator is that they do a lot of things. Matt acknowledged this, but counters by saying that they work hard on user experience and being a good community citizen.</p>
<h3>How have teams changed at Automattic over time?</h3>
<p>Automattic scales by splitting teams when they get too big. Today, there are 46 teams. Some of those teams are embedded in larger teams and have some hierarchy, but the company is still quite flat for a company of 400 people.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb Matt wants to maintain is that someone should have no more than 10 people that report directly to them, though he has around 23.</p>
<p>According to the standards of the tech world, Automattic&#8217;s scale in terms of the number of employees may be somewhat ordinary, but they have still had massive and consistent change over the decade of the company&#8217;s existence. And they are hiring as fast as they can to this day.</p>
<h3>The challenge of customizing WordPress sites</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago, someone from Automattic told me how concerned they were about the WordPress customizer&#8217;s ability to scale, both for use on mobile devices, and as a utility that could manage a lot of features. And I wanted to know how Matt thinks that has evolved, now that the customizer is in such significant use on both WordPress.com and for self-hosted websites.</p>
<p>As he notes, the customizer has undergone a lot of positive iteration over the last several releases, and today the WordPress.com and WordPress.org customizers are using the same base code; whereas for a while WordPress.com had their own custom implementation.</p>
<p>But he still says that, &#8220;If we&#8217;re candid with ourselves, &#8230; customization is still the worst part of WordPress, you know? It&#8217;s the hardest. It&#8217;s where people get stuck. It&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a real gap between the promise and what people are able to realize and create when they get started using WordPress.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as much a problem with the use of themes, or if you can code, but for new users, &#8220;it&#8217;s their biggest struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>One idea that I have is to have a more Medium-like interface be the &#8220;default&#8221; view, versus a changing default theme. That way, WordPress.com could be more opinionated about the default view, and change the theme at will, or along with trends, versus giving new users the default theme of a particular year and then that theme is untouched unless the user decides to switch.</p>
<p>Matt said they have that a bit on the Reader view, but that is what someone in the WordPress.com network would see, versus what an outside website visitor would see.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are definitely challenges ahead for enabling customizations and, more importantly, just ensuring sites look good for users. I think that this is an area where other platforms &#8212; like Medium and Squarespace, though in different ways &#8212; are doing a good job.</p>
<h3>The first line of the Automattic creed</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">Automattic creed</a> states at the very beginning, &#8220;I will never stop learning.&#8221; That was part of Matt&#8217;s response when I asked just how they managed to <a href="http://dentedreality.com.au/2015/11/23/all-new-wordpress-com/">cross-train a workforce</a> that was primarily made of PHP developers to create a world-class JavaScript driven application.</p>
<p>Additionally to the natural desires that Automattic employees should have to learn, they created internal resources for helping people, and are considering releasing some of that material, maybe in the form of webinars or an online conference.</p>
<p>Matt said Automatticians will also be sharing what they learn at other conferences, like the upcoming <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/speakers/">A Day of REST</a>, where two Automatticians will be speaking.</p>
<p>Matt did admit that he hasn&#8217;t made the PHP to JavaScript switch yet, and personally feels more comfortable in PHP; though some of his team have said it wasn&#8217;t as intimidating as it sounds.</p>
<h3>Bug bounties</h3>
<p>Did you know all Automattic properties are on <a href="https://hackerone.com/automattic">Hacker One</a>, the bug bounty community? If you find a security bug, you can get a bounty if you report it. I didn&#8217;t know this until the Calypso launch.</p>
<h3>How is Automattic thinking about revenue?</h3>
<p>With my napkin math and a few small things I know about Automattic, I&#8217;d guesstimate they are somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in annual revenue. I didn&#8217;t even attempt to get confirmation of this, because I know they don&#8217;t reveal this kind of information. So instead I wanted to get more insights of how Matt thinks about revenue at Automattic.</p>
<p>Generally, he says they put their focus in, &#8220;three main buckets.&#8221; They use that focus both for revenue purposes and product purposes. Those areas are WordPress.com, Jetpack, and WooCommerce.</p>
<p>They group things like VaultPress and Akismet under Jetpack; so it&#8217;s basically their WordPress.org SaaS revenue stream. Those are paid subscription products.  They have been transitioning that offering, as Matt shared, &#8220;a big trend over the past few years, has been to move away from a la carte upgrades, and have more bundles.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve discovered that bundled plans of $100 per year and $300 per year have been successful. Here are those plans, for both WordPress.com and WordPress.org, as shown in the new WordPress.com/Calypso interface:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15013" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wp-org-plan.png" alt="wp-org-plan" width="739" height="693" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15014" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wpcom-plan.png" alt="wpcom-plan" width="736" height="798" /></p>
<p>It appears they get most of their revenue from this stream. I do know, and have previously reported, that at least at one point, WordPress.com VIP accounted for upwards of 25% of overall revenue, and though that gross number has gone up over the years, its percentage of overall revenue has gone down, meaning that these paid plans have outpaced VIP, growth-wise. I&#8217;d guess VIP revenue is now less than half of that 25% number now, but can&#8217;t confirm it.</p>
<h3>Total sites, versus engagement</h3>
<p>There are a lot of WordPress.com websites, but as Matt noted, it&#8217;s a vanity metric due to the fact that such a small percentage are active, engaged users. So they are trying more to track engagement versus total sites.</p>
<p>I tried to get him to share the number of active websites, but that&#8217;s not something he could share.</p>
<h3>Helping site owners monetize, and WooCommerce integration to WordPress.com</h3>
<p>I talked about the roadmap some, and asked Matt about what they may offer in the future to help authors monetize their sites. They currently have a <a href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds</a> program, but that is a pageview driven strategy, and I&#8217;d love to see them introduce a way for authors to get paid via a tip jar, private paid posts, or subscription system like I&#8217;ve heard Medium is investigating. It&#8217;s not on their current roadmap, but he says he&#8217;d be open to it.</p>
<p>He also noted that since WooCommerce is now &#8220;part of the family,&#8221; that there may be future monetization opportunities through that, though he said they don&#8217;t have current plans for a hosted version of WooCommerce on WordPress.com. I was honestly pretty surprised by this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the beginning, our focus is really going to be on people hosting their stores, you know, with web hosts. Because, part of the beauty of why WooCommerce is so popular is the flexibility, and I don&#8217;t think the usability is there &#8212; yet &#8212; to be competitive with, like, a  Shopify, or a BigCommerce. So, it&#8217;s just a lot of work to do there.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pullquote alignright">Matt said he thinks of WooCommerce as how WordPress was around version 1.5. He called it, &#8220;very early days&#8221;</span>, in that people are using it and see the potential, but says, &#8220;there&#8217;s just so much to work on and improve to make it accessible to a wider audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says the Woo team is now 63 people, and a number of Automatticians are doing &#8220;Wootations,&#8221; or rotations with the Woo team.</p>
<h3>What to expect next in the new WordPress.com interface</h3>
<p>They are still working on a lot of things for the new interface. There are certain things that aren&#8217;t there yet. For instance, showing and hiding your sites you are personally attached to still requires the regular admin. I actually experienced this myself. Some parts of the interface are pretty circular and confusing.</p>
<p>But they plan to do more going forward; their values on the project state that, &#8220;we are here for the long haul.&#8221; They want to see what there is demand for, and what other people do with the open source nature of the project.</p>
<p>Matt also noted that he&#8217;d like to &#8220;loop back&#8221; to content blocks (code named <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">CEUX</a>) &#8212; the project that stalled last year. And he&#8217;s like to see what can be done around collaboration, editing, and the suggestion process.</p>
<h3>Power and ease of use</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for WordPress is to continue to get easier to use, as other avenues for sharing information have gotten easier and easier, while continuing to enable powerful, feature rich implementations of WordPress.</p>
<p>Matt thinks this balance is important, and that we must continue to improve in both directions to continue WordPress&#8217;s growth.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed my first audio interview with Matt. He says we can expect more announcements around WordCamp US, which starts next week.</p>
<p>The Calypso project is a fascinating one, and it&#8217;s a great example of what we should continue to expect: powerful, catered tools that run on a RESTful API. They aren&#8217;t always going to be tools for use everywhere, but we can expect to continue to see WordPress used in innovative ways, and be an exceptional platform for all kinds of applications.</p>
<p>And finally, at the end of the interview, I pitched Matt on one of my most harebrained ideas. The naming conflict between WordPress.com and WordPress was really bad with this project, as nearly everyone not deeply embedded within the WordPress world got it wrong, and conflated Automattic&#8217;s WordPress.com with WordPress the software.</p>
<p>And I think Jetpack&#8217;s brand has really blossomed. I think there is an argument to be made that Automattic could change the name of WordPress.com to Jetpack, and both Automattic and WordPress would win from the change. It wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but all I asked from him, is whether he&#8217;d read my post if I wrote one to give the pitch. He said he would, so expect that sometime soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to Matt for the interview, and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/markarms">Mark Armstrong</a> for helping me get going with the new WordPress.com app and arranging the interview.</p>

As part of the redesign, download counts were replaced with the number of Active Installs to reflect more accurate data. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress theme directory</a> has finally followed suit by replacing download counts with the number of Active Installs.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ActiveInstallsofTwentyFifteen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49125"><img class="size-full wp-image-49125" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ActiveInstallsofTwentyFifteen.png?resize=891%2C547" alt="Active Installs of Twenty Fifteen" /></a>Active Installs of Twenty Fifteen
<p>As you can see from the above screenshot, the Twenty Fifteen default theme included in WordPress 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, is active on more than one million sites. Active themes are those that are activated and in use on a site. Themes that are installed and not activated are not counted, neither are child themes.</p>
<p>In the Themereview Slack Channel, Tom Usborne <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1447998481000578">explains why</a> active installs for child themes should be counted.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think an argument for child themes to be included in the active installs count can be made. For example, we offer a completely blank child theme for our customers so they can make CSS and PHP adjustments. This means our install count isn&#8217;t accurate on w.org, even though those people are using the theme actively.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dion Hulse, WordPress lead developer, <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1447998501000579">agrees</a> that child themes should be counted but the team doesn&#8217;t have the data yet. Some theme authors are concerned that new themes will have a tough time making it on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/popular/">popular themes page</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, the popular themes page was determined by the number of downloads over the previous week, which led to some authors to try to <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-no-longer-counts-automated-downloads">game the system</a>. Hulse says, &#8220;The actual comparison between active installs and the previous week&#8217;s downloads were very similar, except for a handful of themes that had a lot more downloads than installs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hulse plans to experiment with the algorithms to give newer themes a chance, &#8220;I’m also looking at ranking popular themes based on the age of the theme and installs, which will help promote some of the newer themes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thanks to active install counts for themes, we can see which default WordPress theme is the most popular.</p>
<ul>
<li>Twenty Fifteen 1+ Million</li>
<li>Twenty Fourteen 800K+</li>
<li>Twenty Twelve 500K+</li>
<li>Twenty Eleven 500K+</li>
<li>Twenty Ten 300K+</li>
<li>Twenty Thirteen 300K+</li>
</ul>
<p>Download counts are a terrible way to determine a theme or plugin&#8217;s popularity which is why I support this change. It&#8217;s more accurate and helps to further level the playing field for authors. Are you a fan of the change and if you&#8217;re a theme author, what other stats would you like to see?</p>

The plugin is called <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/theme-designer">Theme Designer</a> and allows authors to manage themes in the WordPress backend. It also displays them on the frontend similar to <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes">WordPress.com</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes">WordPress.org&#8217;s</a> theme pages.</p>
<p>Tadlock has moved beyond using WordPress pages to display and manage themes, &#8220;I’m not sure what everyone else is doing, but I’ve been building and tweaking a custom solution for a number of years. I’ve just never packaged it up and made it useful for others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThemeDesignerPlugin.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49114"><img class="size-full wp-image-49114" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThemeDesignerPlugin.png?resize=1025%2C618" alt="Manage Themes in the WordPress Backend" /></a>Manage Themes in the WordPress Backend
<p>Under the hood, it uses a custom post type, taxonomies, custom metadata, and a number of hooks. Theme Designer can pull data from the WordPress.org theme directory API and store it on your site. There’s also a built-in feature set for adding custom meta fields to the edit theme screen.</p>
<p>In addition to managing themes, Tadlock plans to create add-ons and integrate Theme Designer with other plugins. He&#8217;s already created an add-on for Easy Digital Downloads and it&#8217;s possible he&#8217;ll create one for WooCommerce.</p>
<h2>Tadlock&#8217;s First Commercial Plugin</h2>
<p>During the beta testing period, Theme Designer will be free of charge. When the beta is complete, Tadlock will charge for access making it his first major commercial plugin. Theme Designer will come in two flavors, a supported and non-supported version.</p>
<p>The supported version gives customers a <strong>developer level</strong> membership to Theme Hybrid which is currently $35 a year. The non-supported version contains the plugin only. Both versions will have free lifetime updates.</p>
<p>To participate in the beta testing process, grab the free plugin <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/theme-designer">from GitHub</a>. Pull requests and reporting issues are welcomed. It&#8217;s important to note that Theme Designer is <strong>only compatible</strong> with WordPress 4.4 and is a work in progress so it should not be used on a live site.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I view the shift to this newer, more flexible model as a way for WordPress.com to adapt to become a growing part of the open web. Blogging has always been mistaken for its containers, tools, the length of the posts or just a replacement for the rapid-fire publishing of old-fashioned news. In reality, blogging is essentially a philosophy built on the ethos of sharing.</p>
<p class="p1">Today sharing on the internet is a major social behavior: We share photos, links, videos, thoughts, opinions, news. Except instead of sharing on a blog, we do the sharing in increasingly proprietary and corporate silos: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Periscope and LinkedIn. You see, the blogging ethos is alive and well. However, the old blogging tools have to embrace change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s not about technology for technology&#8217;s sake, it&#8217;s about technology at the service of human voices. Embracing change to support the free, open web where everyone has a voice.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, it was a weird coincidence we didn&#8217;t even notice, but the Calypso announcement was <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2005/11/23/opening-it-up/">ten years to the day after we opened up WordPress.com</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 19:42:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

From managing<a href="http://wptavern.com/you-can-now-search-for-and-install-plugins-from-within-jetpack-manage"> plugins, themes, and other updates</a> to <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/beautiful-makeover/">New Dash</a> and a revamped <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/new-post-screen/">post editor</a>. The individual changes represent iteration but when seen as a whole, show off an entirely new WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Automattic has <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/">announced</a> that the improvements its made in the last two years are part of an internal project <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/">named Calypso</a>. The company also released a WordPress.com desktop application for the Mac and <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">open sourced</a> the code on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The application is written entirely in JavaScript using the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> libraries. It&#8217;s also <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">100% reliant</a> on APIs, including the REST API.</p>
<h2>My Experience with Calypso</h2>
<p>Over the weekend, I tested the application on my Macbook Pro. I initially thought it was inconsistent as there were many instances where a button opened a browser and took me outside the app. However, Calypso has gone through a number of updates and most of the inconsistencies have disappeared.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49080"><img class="wp-image-49080 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png?resize=1025%2C795" alt="Calypso1" /></a>Calypso
<p>Most of what you&#8217;re able to accomplish in the WordPress backend you can do in the app including, editing posts, creating drafts, and moderating comments.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49081"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49081" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png?resize=1025%2C799" alt="Calypso2" /></a>Although there is the occasional Beep&#8230;.Beep&#8230;.Boop, the application is fast. Some of the pages within the app feel like they load faster than their browser counterparts. Some things still require action from within a browser such as applying updates. This doesn&#8217;t make sense considering the Jetpack Manage module is enabled.</p>
<p>When managing themes, I noticed at least two of the them don&#8217;t include the white bottom bar making the titles difficult to read. Also, the details link loads a browser window to the backend of the site I&#8217;m managing. It feels like an interruption instead of a seamless experience. There should be no reason to load a browser window except for previewing a post.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49082"><img class="wp-image-49082 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png?resize=1025%2C790" alt="Calypso3" /></a>Managing Themes in Calypso
<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with or use the WordPress.com post editor, the editor in Calypso is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>For years I&#8217;ve written posts with meta boxes on the right and getting used to them on the left will take a while. The editor has most of the features available in WordPress. For example, oEmbed support which many other third-party WordPress apps don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>When the application is in full-screen mode, it looks great and blocks out distractions. In the most recent update however, the Preview button acts like a Save button and doesn&#8217;t show a preview of the post. This is likely a bug and will be fixed in a later version.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49083"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49083" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png?resize=1025%2C790" alt="CalypsoPostEditingScreen" /></a>Calypso is a great example of what&#8217;s possible with the WordPress REST API. There are still a few instances when clicking a button takes you outside the app but those will be fixed in future updates.</p>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s convenient to have access to most of WordPress&#8217; features without interacting with a browser. For those who use a Mac, I can easily see Calypso being the preferred way to interact and manage WordPress sites.</p>
<p>As Matt Mullenweg <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/">mentions in his post</a>, there&#8217;s still a lot of work left to do, &#8220;This is a beginning, not an ending. (<a href="http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/">1.0 is the loneliest</a>.) Better things are yet to come, as all of you dig in.&#8221; Calypso is <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/">available for free</a> but you&#8217;ll need a <a href="https://wordpress.com/start">WordPress.com account</a> which is also free.</p>
<p>If you own a Mac and test drive Calypso, please share your experience with us in the comments.</p>

The code behind the app is also the foundation for a new version of the WordPress.com browser editor.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video walkthrough:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new WordPress.com app development occurred over the course of at least 18 months, according to the press release, with input from more than 140 Automatticians. <a href="http://apeatling.com/about-me/">Andy Peatling</a>, who has been at Automattic since 2008, was the project lead.</p>
<h3>If you could rebuild the admin from scratch</h3>
<p>Matt Mullenweg said that Automattic wanted to completely rethink the WordPress admin experience, without the burden of backward compatibility that WordPress core must hold sacred:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we’ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calypso was an ambitious project. Not only does it bring the WordPress editing and publishing experience to a Mac app, but pretty much the entire WordPress.com admin experience is now available on the desktop, from stats to theme shopping.</p>
<p>While the app is definitely geared toward the experience one would expect on a WordPress.com website, you can also manage <a href="http://jetpack.me/2015/11/23/jwordpress-com-app-for-mac/">Jetpack enabled</a> websites with it. The Jetpack Manage feature must be enabled for it to work, and I admit I struggled to get it to function with my own (personal) website. However, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll get any kinks worked out, and anyone looking for basic website management, but are on WordPress.org, may enjoy the experience.</p>
<h3>Open sourcing WordPress.com</h3>
<p>The most important part of the announcement is that Automattic is open sourcing Calypso and the many APIs that help drive it.</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I’ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back. We still have a ton to figure out around plugins, extensibility, contributions, Windows and Linux releases, API speed, localization, and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress. Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with Javascript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion. I’m also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really glad they chose to open source it. I agree with Matt that both the app and the broader community will benefit from the decision; though I don&#8217;t doubt it may have been a tough sell to investors.</p>
<p>I also agree with Ben Thompson (a former Automattician, by chance), <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/tensorflow-and-monetizing-intellectual-property/">who once said</a> that proprietary software itself isn&#8217;t necessarily what makes a company successful, but rather, &#8220;companies that are built on software but differentiated by a difficult-to-replicate complement to said software.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Automattic&#8217;s case, open sourcing the techniques to build the app isn&#8217;t giving away what is most valuable. What is most valuable to them is what they gain from the open source nature of the software, that will allow them to improve the experience for their vast WordPress.com user base.</p>
<h3>Calypso is a good step forward for WordPress.com</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve worried for a while now that Automattic may be letting their audience slip, by falling behind the ease of use of other tools, like Medium. I think the new WordPress.com editor, and the corresponding WordPress.com app, are a great improvement to the writing experience, and I think that the investment they&#8217;ve made is a smart one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be digging more into the code and developer components of the new APIs and the Mac app soon. I didn&#8217;t have access to that data prior to launch.</p>
<p>The new app is available for <a href="http://desktop.wordpress.com/">download from WordPress.com</a> now, or you can of course test drive the browser version directly on WordPress.com. You can also see the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">developer features</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso">code on Github</a>, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-story-behind-the-new-wordpress-com">the backstory</a> from Andy Peatling, and see both <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/">WordPress.com&#8217;s announcement</a>, as <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/">well as Matt&#8217;</a>s.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 17:06:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>But we&#8217;re trying our darndest, and have some cool news to introduce today. When I took on the <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/">responsibility of CEO of Automattic January of last year</a>, we faced two huge problems: our growth was constrained by lack of capital, and the technological foundations of the past decade weren’t strong enough for the demands of next one.</p>
<p>The first has a relatively straightforward answer. We found some fantastic partners, agreed on a fair price, <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/">issued new equity in the company to raise $160M</a>, and started investing in areas we felt were high potential, like <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/">this year’s WooCommerce acquisition</a>. This &#8220;war chest&#8221; gives us a huge array of options, especially given our fairly flat burn rate &#8212; we don&#8217;t need to raise money again to keep the company going, and any capital we raise in the future will be purely discretionary. (Since last May when the round happened we&#8217;ve only spent $3M of the investment on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense">opex</a>.)</p>
<p>The second is much harder to address. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> codebase is actually incredible in many ways &#8212; the result of many thousands of people collaborating over 13 years &#8212; but some of WordPress’ greatest strengths were also holding it back.</p>
<p>The WordPress codebase contains a sea of institutional knowledge and countless bug fixes. It handles hundreds of edge cases. Integrates constant security improvements. Is coded to scale. Development moves at a fast clip, with <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/">six major releases over the past two years</a> and more <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-4/">around the corner</a>. Its power and flexibility is undeniable: WordPress just passed a huge milestone, <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/">and now powers 25% of the web</a>. You can run it on a $5-a-month web host, or scale it up to serve billions of pageviews on one of the largest sites on the web, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>.</p>
<p>The interface, however, has been a struggle. Many of us attempted to give it a reboot with the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/">MP6 project</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/">version 3.8 release</a>, but what that release made clear to me is that an incremental approach wouldn&#8217;t give us the improvements we needed, and that two of the things that helped make WordPress the strong, stable, powerful tool it is &#8212; backward compatibility and working without JavaScript &#8212; were actually holding it back.</p>
<p>The basic paradigms of wp-admin are largely the same as they were five years ago. Working within them had become limiting. The time seemed ripe for something new, something big… but if you&#8217;re going to break back compat, it needs to be for a really good reason. A 20x improvement, not a 2x. Most open source projects fade away rather than make evolutionary jumps.</p>
<p>So we asked ourselves a big question. <strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we&#8217;ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing something brand new, a new approach to WordPress, and open sourcing the code behind it. The project, codenamed Calypso, is the culmination of more than 20 months of work by dozens of the most talented engineers and designers I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with (127 contributors with over 26,000 commits!).</p>

<p>A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I&#8217;ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back. We still have a ton to figure out around plugins, extensibility, contributions, Windows and Linux releases, API speed, localization, and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress. Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with JavaScript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion. I&#8217;m also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door.</p>
<p>This is a beginning, not an ending. (<a href="http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/">1.0 is the loneliest</a>.) Better things are yet to come, as all of you dig in. Check out these links to read more about Calypso from different perpsectives:</p>

<p>This was a huge bet, incredibly risky, and difficult to execute, but it paid off. Like any disruption it is uncomfortable, and I&#8217;m sure will be controversial in some circles. What the team has accomplished in such a short time is amazing, and I’m incredibly proud of everyone who has contributed and will contribute in the future. This is the most exciting project I&#8217;ve been involved with in my career.</p>
<p>With core WordPress on the server and Calypso as a client I think we have a good chance to bring another 25% of the web onto open source, making the web a more open place, and people&#8217;s lives <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/">more free</a>.</p>

The post includes data that shows the number of plugins added to the directory per year, what year the plugins were last updated, and other metrics.</p>
<p>My favorite data point is the number of plugins approved per year. Based on this data, it looks like it&#8217;s going to be another record year for the directory. The five active team members including, Mika Epstein, Pippin Williamson, and Samuel Wood have their work cut out for them.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49062"><img class="size-full wp-image-49062" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png?resize=939%2C684" alt="Number of Plugins Added Per Year" /></a>Number of Plugins Added Per Year
<p>According to the data, about 22K plugins have been updated in the last 24 months representing a little more than half the directory. This means that approximately half of the plugins in the directory are displaying a notice that the plugin hasn&#8217;t been updated in two years.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PluginUpdateTwoYearNotice.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49066"><img class="size-full wp-image-49066" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PluginUpdateTwoYearNotice.png?resize=785%2C84" alt="Update Notice After Two Years of No Updates" /></a>Update Notice After Two Years of No Updates
<p>Fracassi says that based on the data, &#8220;Two out of ten plugins are updated after three years. If you pick a free plugin that is released today, there’s a 80-90% chance that in three years time you won’t have any more updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of possibilities as to why a plugin doesn&#8217;t get updated for two years or more.</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer burns out or moves on.</li>
<li>The plugin doesn&#8217;t need an update.</li>
<li>Lack of donations.</li>
<li>Support is too much of a burden.</li>
<li>No time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data doesn&#8217;t spell doom and gloom for users but it clearly shows that many plugins within the directory don&#8217;t have a long shelf life. I encourage you to <a href="https://addendio.com/2015-will-be-a-record-year-for-wordpress-plugins/">read Fracassi&#8217;s post</a> and review the data he&#8217;s collected.

<p>To fix this issue, plugin directories have <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/11/11/making-better-banners-for-your-plugins/">implemented Right to Left support</a> for plugin banners. To take advantage of RTL support, create a new banner and add <strong>-rtl</strong> to the end of the file name. Banner images live in the assets directory.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pluginception/">an example</a> of a plugin banner on the Hebrew directory that has RTL support.</p>

<p>Although RTL banners are active on WordPress.org, they are not available in core. Banners won&#8217;t display properly but the team is working on adding it in time for a WordPress 4.4.1 release.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Wapuu, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://wptavern.com/community-translation-and-wapuu-how-japan-is-shaping-wordpress-history">official, GPL Licensed mascot</a> of the WordPress project. Throughout the year, a number of WordCamps and local communities across the world have created local versions of the character. In fact, the Tavern has its own Wapuu.</p>

<p>The plugin has two settings. You can either replace the default avatar with random Wapuus or replace <strong>all</strong> Gravatars with Wapuu. Wapuuavatar uses a library of images from the <a href="https://github.com/jawordpressorg/wapuu">official Wapuu GitHub repository</a> and art work created by <a href="http://marktimemedia.com/">Michelle Schulp</a>. Here&#8217;s how it looks in action on WP Tavern.</p>

<p>Within the last few weeks, we&#8217;ve received emails from readers wanting to know why it&#8217;s taking so long for new themes to be reviewed on WordPress.org. Some theme authors are having to <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&status=reopened&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=priority&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=time&col=changetime&report=5&order=priority">wait two months</a> or more for their first review.</p>
<p>Ashley Evans submitted <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318">her theme</a> in June and she&#8217;s yet to complete the review process. Throughout that time period, both Evans and the reviewer experienced delays in responding to each other. A few months into the review, the <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:21">reviewer disappeared</a> and Evans was <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:23">assigned a new reviewer</a> two days ago.</p>
<p>Understandably, the experience has discouraged Evan&#8217;s from submitting anymore themes to the directory:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back in August, I said, &#8216;Screw it&#8217; and released the theme as a free download on my blog. This process has basically made me vow to stick to adding plugins to the repo and stop adding any more themes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not blaming the theme review team since I can only imagine how much stuff they have to wade through. It&#8217;s just sad that the process has discouraged me from ever doing it again.</p></blockquote>
<p>On October 9th, Tammie Lister <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/09/forgotten-review-push-sometimes-themes-get-forgotten-in/">updated the Theme Review queues</a> and identified a number of themes that fell through the cracks. Most of those <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?id=26151,26016,26194,25318,26167,25685,25310,25818,25650,26135,26195,25000,23405,23342,24027,24087,24094,24101,24143,24178,24203,26164,26084,24277,25651,24597,24411,25269,25992,25217,24540,25980,25969,25814,25245,25241,25181,25154,25122,25076,25068,24274,24993,25046,24178,24087,24101,24143,24765&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=status&col=time&col=reporter&report=30&order=time">themes were approved</a> or are still in the review process.</p>
<h2>The System is Broken</h2>
<p>Members of the WordPress Theme Review team agree that the system is broken. In June, the team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/">published its suggested roadmap</a> to improve multiple facets of the review process. One of the items on the list to help cut down the review queue is the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/07/automation-here-we-come/">auto-approval</a> of theme updates. However, the team is still hard at work trying to code and implement changes to improve the system.</p>
<h2>Help Them Help You</h2>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27795"><img class="size-full wp-image-27795" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg?resize=1025%2C487" alt="photo credit: Rob Shenk via - cc" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rcsj/2915797223/">Rob Shenk</a> via &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>
<p>One of the items high on the team&#8217;s to-do list is to put more effort towards education. In order to do that, Justin Tadlock says the team has to free up resources, &#8220;We need to free up our biggest resources, which are the team members themselves. However, we can&#8217;t free up those people when they&#8217;re spending 100% of their time doing reviews.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most important thing theme authors can do to speed up the review process is to check that your theme meets the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/">Theme Review Requirements</a>. According to Tadlock, &#8220;The majority of themes submitted don&#8217;t follow the guidelines which considerably slows down the process. Themes will often have 20-30 issues or more. If we can get to a point to where the majority of submissions only have a few minor issues, we really wouldn&#8217;t have a queue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Theme authors who test their themes against <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test">Theme Unit Test Data</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/">Theme Check Plugin</a> substantially improve the system for everyone. What the team needs most is help. Tadlock offers three ways contributors can get involved to improve the situation.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/">Doing reviews</a>.</li>
<li>Tackling Meta Trac tickets related to the theme directory.</li>
<li>Writing tutorials.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tadlock isn&#8217;t sure how to get theme authors to raise the quality of their themes before the initial review, &#8220;That&#8217;s the sort of feedback I want to see from fellow theme authors. What do we need to do to help them get their themes ready before submission?&#8221;</p>
<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
<p>The team is always in need of more theme reviewers. Reviewing themes is a great way to learn theme development and what not to do. If you&#8217;re interested in reviewing themes, read the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/">following document</a> from the Theme Review Handbook. It explains how to set up a testing environment with an example of a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/review-workflow/">testing workflow</a>.</p>
<p>The Theme Review Team also has a project meeting every <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20151110T1800"><abbr class="date" title="2015-11-10T18:00:00+00:00">Tuesday, November 10, 2015, 1:00 PM EST</abbr></a> in the <strong>#themereview</strong> channel on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Slack</a>.</p>
<h2>Exercise Patience</h2>
<p>Exercising patience is a difficult thing to do if you&#8217;ve already waited eight weeks or more for the first review. However, fixing the system is going to take time. If you want to know about the status of your theme and it has an assigned reviewer, you should ask for a status update within the ticket. If your theme doesn&#8217;t have an assigned reviewer, you can ask about its status in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Theme Review Team Slack</a> channel with a link to the theme.</p>

The report includes a thorough analysis of attack data obtained through its WAF or Web Application Firewall.</p>
<p>In the report, Imperva&#8217;s application defense center group analyzed 297,954 attacks and 22,850,023 alerts on 198 of the applications it protects behind its WAF. The data is from January 1st, 2015 &#8211; June 30th, 2015 and provides a solid overview of the number and types of attacks web applications are experiencing.</p>
<p>The report covers a lot of ground but for the purpose of this site, I&#8217;m focusing on WordPress.</p>
<h2>Analysis Methodology</h2>
<p>Automated tools recorded the web applications’ traffic and malicious events were documented in log files. Imperva&#8217;s application defense center group analyzed the data using special-purpose software and its knowledge base.</p>
<p>You can find more information that explains how the data was analyzed on page seven of the report.</p>
<h2>WordPress Is the Most Attacked CMS Application</h2>
<p>Out of the 198 applications protected, Imperva identified 55 that are CMS-based, 20 WordPress applications, 11 Drupal, and 24 that are based on 11 other CMS frameworks.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackIncidentCMSAverage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48998"><img class="size-full wp-image-48998" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackIncidentCMSAverage.png?resize=875%2C470" alt="Average Number of Incidents per Applications CMS Slice" /></a>Average Number of Incidents per Applications CMS Slice
<p>According to the report, CMS applications suffered an average of three times more attacks than non-CMS applications. WordPress applications suffered from 3,497 attacks in the reported period which is 250% more than non-CMS Applications. Note from the above image that spam attacks against WordPress outnumber all other types of attacks.</p>
<p>Imperva says the attraction to CMS applications, especially WordPress is not new.</p>
<blockquote><p>CMS frameworks have an open nature,  with open developer communities that generate a never-ending sequence of plug-ins and add-ons, with varying levels of security. This situation has led to corresponding never-ending flow of CMS vulnerabilities, with WordPress as the leading CMS taking the lead also in the amount of published attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that WordPress and other CMS applications resemble each other facilitates automated scanning attacks that work effectively on all applications of this type with only minimal adjustments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Varying levels of security in plugins have led to many vulnerabilities making WordPress the leader in the amount of published attacks.</p>
<h2>Proportions of Attacks</h2>
<p>Taking spam attacks out of the equation, the most popular attack type against WordPress applications is (RCE) Remote Command Execution with (RFI) Remote File Inclusion taking second place.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49000"><img class="size-full wp-image-49000" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png?resize=719%2C400" alt="Proportion of Attack Types" /></a>Proportion of Attack Types
<ul>
<li>Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is an attack that allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script, on the web server. This attack can lead to data theft or manipulation, malicious code execution on the web server, or malicious code execution on the application client side such as JavaScript execution, which can lead to other attacks. This vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Remote Command Execution (RCE) is an attack that allows the attacker to execute operating system commands in a system shell. The attack exploits applications that suffer from insufficient input validation in conjunction with passing this input to a system shell. The attacker’s payload is executed with the same privileges of the vulnerable application and can lead to full compromise of the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the other monitored CMS applications are written in PHP, RFI attacks on WordPress are significantly higher than all other applications. Imperva offers one possible explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Attackers don’t target a specific application, but start with scanning the Internet for vulnerable applications. A Low Hanging Fruit approach that is simple and effective for the detection of potential RFI targets, would be to run a WordPress test and mount an RFI attack in case of success.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf">report</a> goes on to show geographic attack trends, PHP vs non-PHP attack incidents, traffic volume, case studies, and more.</p>
<h2>No Need to Panic</h2>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s only six months of data, the results don&#8217;t surprise me. WordPress is <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-quarter-of-the-top-10-million-sites-ranked-by-alexa-use-wordpress">used on a quarter of the top 10 million websites</a> ranked by Alexa so of course its going to be the most attacked CMS.</p>
<p>The data in the report reinforces my belief that every public site online is likely being scanned or attacked multiple times a day. Unless you&#8217;re using a service or plugin that logs these types of attacks, its hard to know how popular of a target a site is.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re aware of a plugin or service that provides a user-friendly interface that shows and explains the attacks it&#8217;s protecting against a site, please send me a link in the comments.</p>
<h2>Basic Security Principles</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s imperative that you use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">strong password</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">two-factor authentication</a>. Consider using a service like <a href="https://getclef.com/">Clef</a> that allows you to login to WordPress without a password. I also highly encourage you to read the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-publishes-security-white-paper">WordPress security whitepaper</a> to learn how WordPress protects itself against common attacks mentioned in Imperva&#8217;s report and how to responsibly disclose a WordPress security vulnerability.</p>

Soucie, a WordPress Developer based in Orlando, Florida describes what happened after working with a client that claimed to be hearing disabled.</p>
<p>Soucie went through the usual process of sending over a contract, bringing in a designer, discussing scope, and sending over an invoice. The client then claimed to be in the hospital and requested help to pay for one of the contractors involved in the project because he didn&#8217;t accept credit cards. According to Soucie, this should have been the red flag:</p>
<blockquote><p>But I ignored it because I’ve also been a trusting person who is sympathetic to people with disabilities.  Plus I figured I had proof of everything, so I’d be protected.  I was so wrong.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, the &#8216;client&#8217; was paying with stolen credit cards and the other contractor was in on the scam.  I discovered the scam when they started getting pushy about the contractor receiving his payments.  When leaving to make the final payment, I got a call from the person whose credit card info was stolen.  I reached out to my &#8216;client&#8217; and she had disappeared.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the merchant, Soucie was liable for the transaction. After not receiving help from the FBI Cyber Crimes division and the credit card companies, QuickBooks, Soucie&#8217;s payment processor, went after him for the total amount of $10,000. He was able to get the amount slightly reduced after working with QuickBooks. What looked like an awesome project quickly turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>I highly encourage you to <a href="http://adamsoucie.com/chargebacks-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards/">read his article</a> as it includes tips to protect yourself and why you shouldn&#8217;t be too trusting. What advice do you have for freelancers who accept credit card payments? What signs should freelancers look for to avoid fraudulent scams like this one?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the new owner&#8217;s plans are for Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM.</p>
<h2>Advice for Selling Your Company</h2>
<p>The WordPress ecosystem is filled with thousands of companies from individuals to 50+ person agencies. Haskins offers the following advice for those thinking about selling their business, &#8220;Make sure that the books are buttoned up tight, because every check, every payment, every expense will be scrutinized and will ultimately determine what the appraisal price will be. Run a lean ship as the less overhead you have, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the appraisal process, Haskins had to account for and explain every check number written during the last few months. Although it was a lot of work on his end, he highly recommends using FE International as they manage the negotiating, contract writing, and appraisal processes.</p>
<h2>What’s Next for Haskins?</h2>
<p>Haskins isn&#8217;t giving up WordPress development as he continues to work with the software on a daily basis managing <a href="https://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie</a>. When I asked what&#8217;s next in his WordPress journey, he replied, &#8220;Overall, there will be another project. It&#8217;s just that this chapter of the story is finished. I want to eventually write and publish an eBook on my experiences of starting, running, and selling a business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who do you think the buyer is and what do you think will happen to Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM?</p>

<p>Cover photos are built on top of the BuddyPress Attachments API meaning they should seamlessly integrate into themes. If you need to fine-tune the output for your site, check out the <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/themes/buddypress-cover-images/">following Codex article</a>.</p>
<p>Initially added in BuddyPress 2.2.0, <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/developer/member-types/">Member Types</a> allows developers to categorize the members of their community in a variety of ways. If you use this feature in your community, you can now specify that profile fields be made available to either one, some, or none of the registered Member Types.</p>

<p>Two companion stylesheets are included with 2.4.0 to make sure content looks great on both the TwentySixteen and TwentyThirteen themes.</p>

<p>This release also includes major accessibility improvements to front-end templates and the Dashboard screens. According to BuddyPress developers, accessibility is a major focus of the project and there is a concentrated, ongoing effort to make the software more accessible to users of all abilities.</p>
<p>Thanks to a new <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/themes/theme-compatibility-1-7/template-hierarchy/#single-groups-front-page">template hierarchy</a>, groups can now have unique header images and layouts. Simply use the new <code>front.php</code> template inside the single groups templates directory.</p>

<p>In addition to all of the improvements listed above, 2.4.0 has over 100 bug fixes. It also contains the <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-5-patches-privilege-escalation-issue">security patch</a> applied in 2.3.5.

<p>If you haven&#8217;t tested your plugins and themes with WordPress 4.4, now is a great time to do so. In testing WordPress 4.4 betas on WP Tavern, I discovered two broken plugins. I notified the developers and they quickly released an update addressing the issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.4 is scheduled for release in December.</p>

Launched in 2009 as a plugin called Site Monitor, the service has evolved over time to allow users to upgrade themes, plugins, and WordPress remotely. The service allows an unlimited amount of sites to be tracked for free.</p>
<p>Human Made is not able to devote the time and resources necessary to maintain the service, even as it continues to do well. According to Tom Willmot, Co-founder and CEO of Human Made, the team backed out of the <a href="https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/">premium version</a> of the service due to a lack of resources:</p>
<blockquote><p>We had <a href="https://wpremote.com/blog/">ambitious plans for a version 2</a>, we <a href="https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/">introduced a premium version</a> that we backed out of because we didn’t have the resources to run and grow it, and we’ve got lots of great ideas both from its users and ourselves that we haven’t been able to act on. We’re too busy with other things, including Happytables, our client work, events, and more.</p></blockquote>
<p>WP Remote has over 18K users with more than 96K sites monitored. Here are some other notable statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,850 people logged in during the past 30 days.</li>
<li>1,200 of those have more than five sites added to their account and 110 of them have more than 50 sites monitored.</li>
<li>In the past 30 days WP Remote was used to perform over 20,000 plugin updates.</li>
<li>Each week between 50 and 100 new users sign up and over half of them go on to add a site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although WP Remote converted 60 free users to its premium service, the company eliminated it due to the lack of internal resources to support, develop, and market it. WP Remote also has key relationships with web hosting companies such as, Pressable, BlueHost, and SiteGround.</p>
<p>Before inquiring about purchasing the service, I recommend that you <a href="https://wpremote.com/2013/08/08/the-story-of-wp-remote/">read the history</a> on how it was created. If you&#8217;re interested in acquiring WP Remote or have questions, contact Tom at  <a href="mailto:tom@hmn.md">tom@hmn.md</a>. The company plans to decide who the buyer is by the end of February 2016 and is in early discussions with a few interested parties.</p>

The site launched earlier this year and has more than 170 plugins listed in the directory. Gliebe doesn&#8217;t have the time to manage the project anymore and is looking to give it to someone who is capable of maximizing the site&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>Since May of this year, commercial plugin developers have slowly added their products to the directory. Gliebe explains his original strategy for monetizing the site, &#8220;Build the directory up (get authors to list their plugins) in order to attract traffic (plugin buyers) then monetize it with display ads, affiliate links and/or sponsorships (not yet started).&#8221;</p>
<p>Gliebe spends 1-2 hours per week managing the directory which includes, moderating submissions, moderating comments, moderating reviews, answering emails, and responding to tweets. He suggests that the new owner will need to spend more time marketing in order for the project to keep growing.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting parts of the sale offer is where Gliebe explains what powers the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The site is powered by Easy Digital Downloads, the <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/frontend-submissions/" target="_blank">Frontend Submissions</a> extension, the <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/product-reviews/" target="_blank">Product Reviews</a> extension and Array’s <a href="https://arraythemes.com/themes/checkout-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">Checkout</a> theme (using a child theme for customizations like showing categories on the homepage).</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at the analytics, the site is experiencing low traffic numbers compared to when the site was launched. However, organic search traffic is steadily rising thanks to the content published on the <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/blog/">site&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of Codecanyon, Pro Plugin Directory is one of the only other directories exclusively catered to commercial plugins. Here&#8217;s what Gliebe will give the buyer after purchasing the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The buyer will receive the domain, website files, database dump, mailing lists and Twitter account. Easy Digital Downloads add-on licenses and Checkout theme licenses will be transferred. You will need to purchase a new SSL certificate. I am looking for a capable buyer but if you require migration assistance or technical support after the sale, I will offer my services at $200/hour (five hours max).</p></blockquote>
<p>Escrow will be used to facilitate the sale between both parties. If you&#8217;re interested in taking over the site or have questions, <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/contact/">contact Steven Gliebe.</a></p>

<p>Joe is away this week, so Brian goes solo. Brian highlights WordCamp US and A Day of REST and describes why you should attend these events. He also tells the story of his first ever WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WCUS). Then, he interviews Mike McAlister, of Array Themes, and they talk about the process of building a commercial WordPress theme from the ground up.</p>
<p>The interview with Mike starts around 14 minutes in.</p>

<p>I saw the new Steve Jobs movie a few days ago, which I enjoyed as a movie even though <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/10/22/mossberg-steve-jobs">the main elements were fiction and it should have been titled something else</a>.</p>
<p>But they had an awesome video interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke">the amazing Arthur C. Clarke</a> in 1974, which I&#8217;ve embedded above, where he said the following right around 0:56.</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewer: I wonder though, what sort of a life will it be in social terms if our whole life is built around the computer, if we become a computer-dependent society, computer-dependent individuals.</p>
<p>ACC: In some ways, but they&#8217;ll also enrich our society because it&#8217;ll make it possible for us to live anywhere we like. Any businessman, any executive could live almost anywhere on earth and still do his business through a device like this, and this is a wonderful thing, it means we won&#8217;t have to be stuck in cities, we can live out in the country or wherever we please, and still carry on complete interaction with human beings, as well as with other computers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow, extremely prescient. Remember, this was 1974! The dominant technology companies of today still follow the same office-centric model as when computers took up entire rooms, but the dominant companies of tomorrow will be built and grow in a completely distributed fashion. (And of course, <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/">we&#8217;re hiring</a>.)</p>

<p>In a little less than a month, the first annual <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a> will be underway in Philadelphia, PA. There&#8217;s still <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/">251 tickets available</a> to attend the event in person. The <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/schedule/">schedule and sessions</a> are published and it looks like an informational packed two-day event.</p>
<p>There are three tracks available, two of which will have typical length sessions with a third track dedicated to lightning talks. I highly encourage you to <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/schedule/">view the schedule</a> and create a list of sessions to attend as the first day has over 40 of them.</p>
<p>Reed Gustow, one of the event&#8217;s primary organizers says they&#8217;re expecting a lot of attendees, &#8220;We&#8217;re expecting 2,000 attendees from across the United States and from many other countries, and it will be a wonderful opportunity to learn, share knowledge and meet others in the amazing WordPress community.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to WordCamp US, there will be a <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/11/09/join-us-for-the-wordcamp-us-contributor-day/">WordPress contributor day</a> on December 6th. During contributor day, people from all walks of life get together and contribute to various parts of the WordPress project whether it&#8217;s the support forums, core code, documentation, and more. Mentors will be on hand to help new contributors.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the most important information is where to eat a great tasting cheesesteak. After all, it&#8217;s one of the things <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/itineraries/philadelphia/where-to-find-the-best-cheesesteaks-in-philadelphia/">Philadelphia is known for</a>. The WordCamp US organizing team has you <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/11/09/the-cheesesteak-post/">covered with a post</a> that describes the different types of cheesesteaks and where to find the best tasting ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/location/">Hotel and venue information</a> for the event is on the WordCamp US website. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not attending the event this year, but <a href="http://wptavern.com/contributors">Sarah Gooding</a> will be there. If you see her, stop her and say hi.</p>

<p>Drupal and Joomla, two other popular open source content management systems combine for 4.9%, slightly less than 1/5th of WordPress.</p>
<p>W3Techs counts both self hosted WordPress and WordPress.com sites, &#8220;We only count the hosted sites if they are reachable via their own domain (not only as subdomain of wordpress.com), and they must qualify like all other sites in our surveys by getting enough visitors on that separate domain to make it into the top 10 million Alexa sites,&#8221; Gelbmann says.</p>
<p>This means that only those sites on WordPress.com that use domain mapping and have enough traffic to be in the top 10 million Alexa sites are counted leaving millions of WordPress.com sites uncounted. Only 1.25% of WordPress sites in the survey are hosted at WordPress.com.</p>
<h2>The Fastest Growing CMS</h2>
<p>The survey also shows that WordPress is still the fastest growing CMS, &#8220;Every 74 seconds a site within the top 10 million starts using WordPress. Compare this with Shopify, the second-fastest growing CMS, which is gaining a new site every 22 minutes,&#8221; Gelbmann says.</p>
<p>When sites are broken down into languages, WordPress is used on 37.3% of English language sites. Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish sites are inbetween 38-40% while Bengali is 51.3% and 54.4% for Bosnian. Only 10.6% of WordPress sites are in Chinese with 6.9% for Korean.</p>
<p>About 94% of sites surveyed use a Unix-like operating system such as Ubuntu. Windows servers host 6.2% of WordPress sites making it the most popular CMS running on Windows servers.</p>
<p>Matt Mullenweg, Co-founder of the WordPress project, says the <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/">largest opportunity for growth</a> is in the 57% of sites not using <em>any</em> identifiable CMS. Earlier this year, we learned that <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share">Jetpack is going to play a significant role</a> in WordPress gaining 50% or more of market share.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://kitchensinkwp.com/podcast-e048-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/" target="_blank">interview with Adam Silver on the KitchensinkWP podcast</a>, Mullenweg explains the path to 50% and beyond.</p>
<blockquote><p>The next goal is the majority of websites. We want to get to 50%+ and there’s a lot of work between now and then. As the percentage increases, it gets harder and harder to grow the market share, and we have to grow the market share by doing things we haven’t done in the past – really thinking about the onboarding process, really thinking about the integration with social networks, and with how WordPress works on touch devices, which is going to be the predominant computing platform of the future. These things are going to be really important.</p>
<p>What got us here isn’t going to get us there. Once we get to 50%, we can decide something new we want to do</p></blockquote>
<p>Automattic is experimenting with a new side project called <a href="https://github.com/automattic/jetpack-onboarding">Jetpack Onboarding</a>. The project is an attempt to improve WordPress&#8217; new user experience. Hosting companies that choose to implement it can modify, add, or remove steps.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that W3Techs&#8217; market share numbers are based on the top 10 million sites in Alexa. Fifty percent market share is 5 million of those 10 million sites. Are these the sites WordPress should be targeting with development efforts? Are they more important than the millions of sites not ranked by Alexa? I don&#8217;t think so but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Sometimes it goes up and down through the course of a month, but it&#8217;s still a pretty fun milestone that we can now say about one in four websites are now powered by the <a href="https://wordpress.org/">scrappy open source underdog</a> with its roots stretching all the way back to a single person in Corsica, France. We should be comfortably past 25% by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The big opportunity is still the 57% of websites that don&#8217;t use <em>any</em> identifiable CMS yet, and that&#8217;s where I think there is still a ton of growth for us (and I&#8217;m also rooting for all the other open source CMSes).</p>

Communicating online is hard but where and how you communicate affects the likelihood of making an impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmscritic.com/">CMS Critic</a> is a site I&#8217;ve read for years as it routinely publishes articles on a variety of content management systems, including WordPress.</p>
<p>In late October, Kaya Ismail <a href="http://www.cmscritic.com/how-wordpress-needs-to-improve-itself/">published an article</a> that describes how WordPress needs to improve itself in six ways. What could have been a great article, is instead a great example of <strong>how not to</strong> communicate grievances you have with WordPress.</p>
<h2>Twenty Sixteen Developers Are Lazy</h2>
<p>Many people, including myself <a href="http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme#comments">have an opinion</a> of the Twenty Sixteen theme in WordPress 4.4. Ismail thinks the developers behind the theme are lazy.</p>
<blockquote><p>I totally understand that WordPress doesn&#8217;t need to compete with the massive library of third-party themes available out there, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they should lead with a default theme as bad as that. It&#8217;s nothing short of lazy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tammie Lister, Takashi Irie, and others continue to work hard on Twenty Sixteen to prepare it for the WordPress 4.4 release in December. They are far from lazy people making Ismail&#8217;s opinion more of an insult. He doesn&#8217;t provide any examples or ideas on what should be in a default theme.</p>
<h2>The WordPress Plugin Directory</h2>
<p>According to Ismail, the WordPress plugin directory is filled with large chunks of trash in addition to great plugins. While some plugins in the directory could be coded better, his explanation falls short of describing a solution.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many plugins simply don&#8217;t work, while many more are poorly put together, which in turn makes WordPress as a platform harder to use. Quality control needs to improve.</p></blockquote>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t link to plugins that are broken, provide any code samples, or show where quality control is lacking. His statement is an assumption that&#8217;s not backed by evidence.</p>
<p>Those who <a href="http://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-with-mika-epstein">oversee the plugin directory</a> don&#8217;t test every submitted plugin to make sure it works with WordPress. Among other things, their job is to make sure plugin submissions don&#8217;t have security issues. If the moderators performed quality control on every plugin, the submission queue would likely have a substantial backlog.</p>
<p>Instead of writing baseless assumptions, Ismail should monitor the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/">Make WordPress Plugins</a> site to stay on top of what&#8217;s going on with the plugin directory and submit feedback where necessary. If a broken plugin is discovered, he should create a forum thread within the plugin&#8217;s support area.</p>
<p>This way, his feedback is seen by those who directly control the WordPress plugin directory. The simple act of reporting a broken plugin to the developer is a major step towards being part of the solution and not the problem.</p>
<h2>Admin Menu Clutter</h2>
<p>I agree with Ismail&#8217;s opinion that the WordPress admin menus can become cluttered if the right plugins are activated. At least in this case, he suggests an alternative.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like to see WordPress group third-party menu options together, in a way that&#8217;s a little more organized and less intrusive. Perhaps this can be done by giving them a sub-section within the menu which can be collapsed. The solution itself is up to them, but the problem is evident.</p></blockquote>
<p>There <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Menus">are guidelines</a> for when plugin developers should create top-level or sub-level menu items but they&#8217;re not followed as well as they could be. Without strictly enforcing these guidelines, it&#8217;s out of WordPress&#8217; hands. The complaint is aimed in the wrong direction and should point towards third-party developers, not WordPress itself.</p>
<p>If you want more control in how items are displayed in the admin menu, I recommend using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-humility/">Menu Humility</a> plugin by Mark Jaquith.</p>
<h2>Akismet is Not Enough</h2>
<p>According to Ismail, comment spam is a major issue with WordPress sites and Akismet doesn&#8217;t do enough to stop it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Akismet, a spam comment filter, now comes with every WordPress install &#8211; which is a good thing. But the free version doesn&#8217;t do enough for me, as comments still pile up in the back end. If you ask me, WordPress needs to find another way to turn the unrelenting tide of spam.</p></blockquote>
<p>To clarify, Akismet has been bundled with WordPress since <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2005/12/wp2/">version 2.0</a> and there&#8217;s no difference between the free and commercial versions in how Akismet protects sites. He doesn&#8217;t provide any suggestions on what WordPress could do to thwart spam but says it has to do something.</p>
<p>What are members of the WordPress core team supposed to do with this kind of feedback? It&#8217;s not helpful, doesn&#8217;t provide any ideas, and is easy to discard.</p>
<h2>Updates are Hard</h2>
<p>Depending on your webhost&#8217;s configuration, updating themes, plugins, and WordPress is as simple as clicking a button. For the more adventurous, you can configure them to happen automatically. For Ismail, the update process is difficult.</p>
<blockquote><p>Updating a plugin may cause conflicts between it and another plugin. Updating a theme can erase your modifications (unless you use a child theme), whereas updating WordPress itself can render a variety of your plugins redundant until their developers apply a patch. Confused yet? You should be.</p></blockquote>
<p>He makes a few good points but editing a theme instead of a child theme is like editing WordPress core files which should almost never happen. It&#8217;s true that there is a slight risk of <a href="http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites">things breaking</a> after an update but it&#8217;s more of an anomaly than a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Ismail suggests that WordPress look into preserving theme changes across the board and to provide alerts if  plugins interfere with each other. I like these suggestions and my hope is that one day, WordPress will be able to create a snapshot during the update process to provide assurance that the site won&#8217;t break after an update is applied.</p>
<h2>WordPress Hack-a-thon</h2>
<p>Ismail&#8217;s last point is how WordPress can improve its security.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think we can all agree that WordPress needs to beef itself up (by shoring up its admin login page, for example), but I call for it to go a step further and start offering better protection, even if it comes at a small price.</p>
<p>Third party solutions exist, sure. But why should I have to patch together several security plugins, each with their own confusing settings, just to secure my website? Many WordPress users have become accustom to handling their own security in this way; but I think WordPress needs to take on more responsibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>He wants WordPress to go a step further and offer better protection but doesn&#8217;t say what that protection is. He also doesn&#8217;t explain where, how, or why WordPress should take on more responsibility to make sites more secure.</p>
<h2>Be Part of the Solution, Not the Problem</h2>
<p>Ismail concludes his article by saying it&#8217;s time for WordPress to innovate. He also says, &#8220;The onus isn&#8217;t on me to provide the solution, it&#8217;s upon WordPress. And it&#8217;s about time they started coming up with innovative solutions for their long-standing issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The article is <a href="https://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-4.4-beta-bare-bones/">another example</a> of how CMS Critic chooses not to be part of the solution. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but airing grievances which sound more like demands and telling core developers to start innovating is not a recipe for results.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/contributing-to-wordpress/">This quote</a> from WordPress core developer, Mark Jaquith, eloquently describes how important communication skills are in an open source project.</p>
<blockquote><p>The number one skill you need for just about any job, but specifically working on open source, is communication skills. You need to have clarity, consistency, compassion, relatability, a little bit of a thick skin and a decent sense of humor.</p></blockquote>
<p>The onus may not be on Ismail or any of us to come up with solutions, but he and others can help discover and be part of solutions by taking an active role in giving constructive feedback in <a href="http://hughlashbrooke.com/2015/11/03/a-non-developers-guide-to-getting-involved-in-wordpress-core-development/">the right place</a>. WordPress has its fair share of issues but there are <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/contributing-to-wordpress/">plenty of opportunities</a> for people to step up and contribute to make the software better.</p>

<p>You can configure the badge&#8217;s width, layout, and choose between a light or dark color scheme. A Google+ icon has also been added to the Social Media Icons widget bringing the total number of available icons to nine.</p>
<p>Those who use the Shortcode Embeds module can now easily embed videos from <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a> using the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/videos/twitch-tv-shortcode/">[ twitchtv ] shortcode</a>. The shortcode&#8217;s attributes allow you to modify the width, height, and whether or not the video autoplays.</p>
<p>In previous versions of Jetpack, the Contact Form module checkbox field type was limited to a single item. In Jetpack 3.8, check box field types can have multiple items.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JetpackContactFormMultipleFields.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48855"><img class="size-full wp-image-48855" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JetpackContactFormMultipleFields.png?resize=746%2C713" alt="Multiple Options Field" /></a>Multiple Options Field
<p>One of my favorite enhancements in Jetpack 3.8 is the improved styling to contact form email responses. In previous versions of Jetpack, emails <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/49">didn&#8217;t match the order of the fields</a> within the contact form. Now, any responses to the contact form will show up in the order you set.</p>
<p>Other notable improvements in Jetpack 3.8 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of new filters to allow further customization of Jetpack.</li>
<li>Better error messaging for Subscription Widget sign up forms.</li>
<li>Improvements and enhancements to accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to features and bug fixes, this release contains contributions from Daisuke Takahashi and Eduardo Reveles. Takahashi lives in Japan and is responsible for the Google+ Badge Widget. Reveles not only filed a <a href="https://github.com/osiux">substantial amount of issue reports on Github</a> but also submitted a lot of patches.</p>

Six years <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10142">in the making</a>, taxonomy term meta <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/">will be available</a> in WordPress 4.4.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me and don&#8217;t have a clue as to what taxonomy term meta is, I highly encourage you to read Justin Tadlock&#8217;s <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/introduction-to-wordpress-term-meta">explanation and tutorial</a>. In the post, Tadlock explains why term meta is significant and some of the possibilities it affords developers.</p>
<p>After reading through the tutorial, I have a better understanding as to why developers are so excited. Not only does it create more opportunities to extend WordPress, but does so in a standard and expected way. Previous to WordPress 4.4, developers had to rely on work-arounds to add term meta to taxonomies.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the tutorial and how you plan to take advantage of this feature once WordPress 4.4 is released.</p>

<p>Citations are inserted into the post with HTML5 markup. The blockquote button retains its default behaviour with highlighted text. I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.4 beta 3 and it works as advertised.</p>
<p>I did notice however, that the citation displays immediately after the last character in the quote. I&#8217;d prefer to have</p>
<p>a space between the last character and the citation.</p>

The guide explains how and where to provide feedback and how important it is to beta test new features.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve used WP Tavern to advocate for and against features in WordPress. One of the best pieces of advice I can give non-developers is to organize your thoughts or stance on a specific feature or direction and publish them on your site. This allows you to control the conversation and gives you plenty of space to explain your perspective.</p>
<p>A great example <a href="http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress">is this post</a> asking for help to add comment moderation approval notifications to WordPress. I explain why it&#8217;s needed with a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717">link to the ticket</a> I created to keep track of the conversation. I prefer to write about potential features and based on feedback, I&#8217;ll either create a trac ticket myself or someone will do it for me with a link to the post.</p>
<p>The Tavern is in the dashboard and is read by a large audience, including core developers. However, thanks to social media, a well constructed post with solid points will make the rounds on Twitter, Facebook, and within WordPress sub-communities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s those posts and associated comments that serve as one of many foundations for change in WordPress without touching a line of code. Keep in mind that there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll be able to directly influence WordPress core development with words alone, but respectful, in-depth conversations with differing opinions and perspectives are an important part of the community regardless.</p>

He created the campaign to generate funding to develop a CLI interface for the WordPress REST API.</p>
<p>According to Bachhuber, the project will allow WordPress REST API endpoints registered via plugins and themes to automatically be usable as WP-CLI commands. Developers will also be able to push and pull posts including, custom post types, users, and other WordPress REST API data between separate WordPress installations with a simple WP-CLI command.</p>
<p>Bachhuber requested $17.5K and within twelve hours of publishing the campaign, he received more than the asking amount from 51 backers, including one who contributed $8,500. Bachhuber will donate one hour of time to the WordPress REST API project in 2016 for every $100 over the funding goal. Based on the current amount, that&#8217;s 46 hours.</p>
<p>With funding in place, Bachhuber will work on the project throughout the first half of 2016, &#8220;$17,500 represents 150 hours of development at $100/hour, plus Kickstarter&#8217;s cut and costs associated with the rewards. I intend to use this time over the first six months of 2016,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still 28 days left in the campaign and if it reaches $40K, he pledges to help figure out how the REST API will handle <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/1055">password protected posts</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the animations are more distracting than they are useful and add a small delay when viewing images. The full-size images are not large enough and appear blurry when clicked on. If 93Digital removes the animations and uses larger images, the timeline would be a nice way to visually browse through WordPress&#8217; history.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to see clear, large images of past WordPress releases and learn about some of the key features in each version, I recommend reading <a href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/wordpress-through-the-ages">WordPress through the ages</a>. Through the images, you can see the natural progression of features, designs, and layouts WordPress has gone through during the past 10 years.</p>

Они шумят, говорят, спорят, дискуссируют между собой.
Но разве знают они корни науки, если строят фундамент Науки на абстрактных идеях.
Фундамент классической механики построен на абстрактном отдельном абсолютном пространстве и абстрактном отдельном абсолютном времени Ньютона.
Фундамент термодинамики построен на абстрактной теории Идеального газа.
Фундамент теории излучения построен на абстрактной теории Черного тела.
Фундамент СТО построен на абстрактной теории отрицательного Четырехмерного пространства.
На этом абстрактном фундаменте физики строят конкретное здание науки и потом удивляются, что есть некоторые парадоксы в природе.
Но не в природе наблюдаются парадоксы.
Что- то не в порядке с логическим мышлением.
Надо бы остановиться, оглянутся назад и пересмотреть абстрактный фундамент науки.
Но все спешат куда-то вперед и, чтобы понять реальность, создают новые абстракции.

<p style="text-align: justify;">ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY-SEVEN CENTS. THAT WAS ALL. AND SIXTY CENTS of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\'s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of "Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn\'t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\'s gold watch that had been his father\'s and his grandfather\'s. The other was Della\'s hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty\'s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now Della\'s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let\'s have a sight at the looks of it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Down rippled the brown cascade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Give it to me quick" said Della.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\'s present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim\'s. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If Jim doesn\'t kill me," she said to herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he\'ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At 7 o\'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: "Please, God, make him think I am still pretty."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was with out gloves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Della wriggled off the table and went for him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Jim, darling," she cried, "don\'t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn\'t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It\'ll grow out again--you won\'t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say \'Merry Christmas!\' Jim, and let\'s be happy. You don\'t know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I\'ve got for you."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You\'ve cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Don\'t you like me just as well, anyhow? I\'m me without my hair, ain\'t I?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim looked about the room curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You say your hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You needn\'t look for it," said Della. "It\'s sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It\'s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. I his dark assertion will be illuminated later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Don\'t make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don\'t think there\'s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you\'ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Isn\'t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\'ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Dell," said he, "let\'s put our Christmas presents away and keep \'em a while. They\'re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.</p>', 'The Gift of the Magi', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-gift-of-the-magi', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:20:13', '2015-12-03 08:20:13', '', '0', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=20', '0', 'post', '', '0' );

<p style="text-align: center;">ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY-SEVEN CENTS. THAT WAS ALL. AND SIXTY CENTS of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\'s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of "Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn\'t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\'s gold watch that had been his father\'s and his grandfather\'s. The other was Della\'s hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty\'s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So now Della\'s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let\'s have a sight at the looks of it."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Down rippled the brown cascade.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Give it to me quick" said Della.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\'s present.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim\'s. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"If Jim doesn\'t kill me," she said to herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he\'ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"</p>

My hair grows awfully fast. Say \'Merry Christmas!\' Jim, and let\'s be happy. You don\'t know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I\'ve got for you."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You\'ve cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Don\'t you like me just as well, anyhow? I\'m me without my hair, ain\'t I?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim looked about the room curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You say your hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You needn\'t look for it," said Della. "It\'s sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It\'s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. I his dark assertion will be illuminated later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Don\'t make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don\'t think there\'s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you\'ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Isn\'t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\'ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Dell," said he, "let\'s put our Christmas presents away and keep \'em a while. They\'re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.</p>', 'The Gift of the Magi', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '20-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:07:13', '2015-12-03 08:07:13', '', '20', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=23', '0', 'revision', '', '0' );

<p style="text-align: justify;">Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little thing!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year\'s Eve; yes, of that she thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant\'s house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an expression of love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Grandmother!" cried the little one. "Oh, take me with you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. "She wanted to warm herself," people said. No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year.</p>', 'The Little Match Girl', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-little-match-girl', '', '', '2015-12-04 00:23:35', '2015-12-04 00:23:35', '', '0', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=24', '0', 'post', '', '0' );

It was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o\'clock. There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the absence of sun. This fact did not worry the man. He was used to the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky- line and dip immediately from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce- covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hair-line was the trail--the main trail--that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But all this--the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all--made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man\'s frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man\'s place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As he turned to go on, he spat speculatively. There was a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him. He spat again. And again, in the air, before it could fall to the snow, the spittle crackled. He knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had crackled in the air. Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below--how much colder he did not know. But the temperature did not matter. He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where the boys were already. They had come over across the divide from the Indian Creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the Yukon. He would be in to camp by six o\'clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper would be ready. As for lunch, he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket. It was also under his shirt, wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin. It was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing. He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm-whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the man\'s heels trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man\'s judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man\'s brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man\'s heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle, and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man\'s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly, the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing with every warm, moist breath he exhaled. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did not mind the appendage. It was the penalty all tobacco- chewers paid in that country, and he had been out before in two cold snaps. They had not been so cold as this, he knew, but by the spirit thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles, crossed a wide flat of nigger-heads, and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek, and he knew he was ten miles from the forks. He looked at his watch. It was ten o\'clock. He was making four miles an hour, and he calculated that he would arrive at the forks at half-past twelve. He decided to celebrate that event by eating his lunch there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dog dropped in again at his heels, with a tail drooping discouragement, as the man swung along the creek-bed. The furrow of the old sled-trail was plainly visible, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners. In a month no man had come up or down that silent creek. The man held steadily on. He was not much given to thinking, and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o\'clock he would be in camp with the boys. There was nobody to talk to and, had there been, speech would have been impossible because of the ice-muzzle on his mouth. So he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber beard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his cheek-bones and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this automatically, now and again changing hands. But rub as he would, the instant he stopped his cheek-bones went numb, and the following instant the end of his nose went numb. He was sure to frost his cheeks; he knew that, and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps. Such a strap passed across the cheeks, as well, and saved them. But it didn\'t matter much, after all. What were frosted cheeks? A bit painful, that was all; they were never serious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Empty as the man\'s mind was of thoughts, he was keenly observant, and he noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and bends and timber- jams, and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around a bend, he shied abruptly, like a startled horse, curved away from the place where he had been walking, and retreated several paces back along the trail. The creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom--no creek could contain water in that arctic winter--but he knew also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice of the creek. He knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their danger. They were traps. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there were alternate layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes wetting himself to the waist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was why he had shied in such panic. He had felt the give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden ice-skin. And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, for he would be forced to stop and build a fire, and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins. He stood and studied the creek-bed and its banks, and decided that the flow of water came from the right. He reflected awhile, rubbing his nose and cheeks, then skirted to the left, stepping gingerly and testing the footing for each step. Once clear of the danger, he took a fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps. Usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken, candied appearance that advertised the danger. Once again, however, he had a close call; and once, suspecting danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front. The dog did not want to go. It hung back until the man shoved it forward, and then it went quickly across the white, unbroken surface. Suddenly it broke through, floundered to one side, and got away to firmer footing. It had wet its forefeet and legs, and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice. It made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs, then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had formed between the toes. This was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet. It did not know this. It merely obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being. But the man knew, having achieved a judgment on the subject, and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the ice- particles. He did not expose his fingers more than a minute, and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them. It certainly was cold. He pulled on the mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At twelve o\'clock the day was at its brightest. Yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the horizon. The bulge of the earth intervened between it and Henderson Creek, where the man walked under a clear sky at noon and cast no shadow. At half-past twelve, to the minute, he arrived at the forks of the creek. He was pleased at the speed he had made. If he kept it up, he would certainly be with the boys by six. He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch. The action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers. He did not put the mitten on, but, instead, struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against his leg. Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat. The sting that followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled, he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit. He struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten, baring the other hand for the purpose of eating. He tried to take a mouthful, but the ice-muzzle prevented. He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. He chuckled at his foolishness, and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers. Also, he noted that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already passing away. He wondered whether the toes were warm or numbed. He moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numbed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up. He was a bit frightened. He stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet. It certainly was cold, was his thought. That man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country. And he had laughed at him at the time! That showed one must not be too sure of things. There was no mistake about it, it was cold. He strode up and down, stamping his feet and threshing his arms, until reassured by the returning warmth. Then he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire. From the undergrowth, where high water of the previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his firewood. Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring fire, over which he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits. For the moment the cold of space was outwitted. The dog took satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the man had finished, he filled his pipe and took his comfortable time over a smoke. Then he pulled on his mittens, settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears, and took the creek trail up the left fork. The dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire. This man did not know cold. Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold, of real cold, of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point. But the dog knew; all its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the knowledge. And it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful cold. It was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer space whence this cold came. On the other hand, there was keen intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other, and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip- lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. So the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man. It was not concerned in the welfare of the man; it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire. But the man whistled, and spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes, and the dog swung in at the man\'s heels and followed after.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard. Also, his moist breath quickly powdered with white his moustache, eyebrows, and lashes. There did not seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the Henderson, and for half an hour the man saw no signs of any. And then it happened. At a place where there were no signs, where the soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath, the man broke through. It was not deep. He wetted himself half-way to the knees before he floundered out to the firm crust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was angry, and cursed his luck aloud. He had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o\'clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he would have to build a fire and dry out his foot-gear. This was imperative at that low temperature--he knew that much; and he turned aside to the bank, which he climbed. On top, tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water deposit of dry firewood--sticks and twigs principally, but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine, dry, last-year\'s grasses. He threw down several large pieces on top of the snow. This served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt. The flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket. This burned even more readily than paper. Placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his danger. Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it. He squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy- five below zero, a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire--that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this the man knew. The old-timer on Sulphur Creek had told him about it the previous fall, and now he was appreciating the advice. Already all sensation had gone out of his feet. To build the fire he had been forced to remove his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb. His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the surface of his body and to all the extremities. But the instant he stopped, the action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold. So long as he walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly, to the surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body. The extremities were the first to feel its absence. His wet feet froze the faster, and his exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they had not yet begun to freeze. Nose and cheeks were already freezing, while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But he was safe. Toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the frost, for the fire was beginning to burn with strength. He was feeding it with twigs the size of his finger. In another minute he would be able to feed it with branches the size of his wrist, and then he could remove his wet foot-gear, and, while it dried, he could keep his naked feet warm by the fire, rubbing them at first, of course, with snow. The fire was a success. He was safe. He remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek, and smiled. The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below. Well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he had saved himself. Those old-timers were rather womanish, some of them, he thought. All a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all right. Any man who was a man could travel alone. But it was surprising, the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing. And he had not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time. Lifeless they were, for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig, and they seemed remote from his body and from him. When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it. The wires were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of which counted for little. There was the fire, snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame. He started to untie his moccasins. They were coated with ice; the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron half-way to the knees; and the mocassin strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration. For a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the folly of it, he drew his sheath-knife.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But before he could cut the strings, it happened. It was his own fault or, rather, his mistake. He should not have built the fire under the spruce tree. He should have built it in the open. But it had been easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the fire. Now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs. No wind had blown for weeks, and each bough was fully freighted. Each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight agitation to the tree--an imperceptible agitation, so far as he was concerned, but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster. High up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow. This fell on the boughs beneath, capsizing them. This process continued, spreading out and involving the whole tree. It grew like an avalanche, and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire, and the fire was blotted out! Where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man was shocked. It was as though he had just heard his own sentence of death. For a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been. Then he grew very calm. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right. If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have built the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire over again, and this second time there must be no failure. Even if he succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes. His feet must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before the second fire was ready.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such were his thoughts, but he did not sit and think them. He was busy all the time they were passing through his mind, he made a new foundation for a fire, this time in the open; where no treacherous tree could blot it out. Next, he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water flotsam. He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out, but he was able to gather them by the handful. In this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable, but it was the best he could do. He worked methodically, even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength. And all the while the dog sat and watched him, a certain yearning wistfulness in its eyes, for it looked upon him as the fire-provider, and the fire was slow in coming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When all was ready, the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it. Try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended to put him in a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a time he was aware of the first far-away signals of sensation in his beaten fingers. The faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was excruciating, but which the man hailed with satisfaction. He stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the birch-bark. The exposed fingers were quickly going numb again. Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches. But the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers. In his effort to separate one match from the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow. He tried to pick it out of the snow, but failed. The dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch. He was very careful. He drove the thought of his freezing feet; and nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his whole soul to the matches. He watched, using the sense of vision in place of that of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch, he closed them--that is, he willed to close them, for the wires were drawn, and the fingers did not obey. He pulled the mitten on the right hand, and beat it fiercely against his knee. Then, with both mittened hands, he scooped the bunch of matches, along with much snow, into his lap. Yet he was no better off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands. In this fashion he carried it to his mouth. The ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth. He drew the lower jaw in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match. He succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap. He was no better off. He could not pick it up. Then he devised a way. He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg. Twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it. As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark. But the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically. The match fell into the snow and went out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right, he thought in the moment of controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel with a partner. He beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation. Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth. He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands. His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at once! There was no wind to blow them out. He kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He could smell it. Deep down below the surface he could feel it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his hands apart. The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but the birch-bark was alight. He began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame. He could not pick and choose, for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his hands. Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth. He cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly. It meant life, and it must not perish. The withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him begin to shiver, and he grew more awkward. A large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little fire. He tried to poke it out with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him poke too far, and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire, the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering. He tried to poke them together again, but in spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with him, and the twigs were hopelessly scattered. Each twig gushed a puff of smoke and went out. The fire-provider had failed. As he looked apathetically about him, his eyes chanced on the dog, sitting across the ruins of the fire from him, in the snow, making restless, hunching movements, slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other, shifting its weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head. He remembered the tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed a steer and crawled inside the carcass, and so was saved. He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them. Then he could build another fire. He spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal, who had never known the man to speak in such way before. Something was the matter, and its suspicious nature sensed danger,--it knew not what danger but somewhere, somehow, in its brain arose an apprehension of the man. It flattened its ears down at the sound of the man\'s voice, and its restless, hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man. He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog. This unusual posture again excited suspicion, and the animal sidled mincingly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness. Then he pulled on his mittens, by means of his teeth, and got upon his feet. He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth. His erect position in itself started to drive the webs of suspicion from the dog\'s mind; and when he spoke peremptorily, with the sound of whip-lashes in his voice, the dog rendered its customary allegiance and came to him. As it came within reaching distance, the man lost his control. His arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers. He had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more. All this happened quickly, and before the animal could get away, he encircled its body with his arms. He sat down in the snow, and in this fashion held the dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But it was all he could do, hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there. He realized that he could not kill the dog. There was no way to do it. With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor throttle the animal. He released it, and it plunged wildly away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling. It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked forward. The man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of his arms. It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were. He began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides. He did this for five minutes, violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering. But no sensation was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him. This threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old, dim trail. The dog joined in behind and kept up with him. He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his life. Slowly, as he ploughed and floundered through the snow, he began to see things again--the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the leafless aspens, and the sky. The running made him feel better. He did not shiver. Maybe, if he ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway, if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys. Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there. And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it was too many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff and dead. This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider. Sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard, but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body. He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no connection with the earth. Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury, and he wondered if Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it: he lacked the endurance. Several times he stumbled, and finally he tottered, crumpled up, and fell. When he tried to rise, he failed. He must sit and rest, he decided, and next time he would merely walk and keep on going. As he sat and regained his breath, he noted that he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He was not shivering, and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk. And yet, when he touched his nose or cheeks, there was no sensation. Running would not thaw them out. Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. Then the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be extending. He tried to keep this thought down, to forget it, to think of something else; he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused, and he was afraid of the panic. But the thought asserted itself, and persisted, until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen. This was too much, and he made another wild run along the trail. Once he slowed down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending itself made him run again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels. When he fell down a second time, it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and intent. The warmth and security of the animal angered him, and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly. This time the shivering came more quickly upon the man. He was losing in his battle with the frost. It was creeping into his body from all sides. The thought of it drove him on, but he ran no more than a hundred feet, when he staggered and pitched headlong. It was his last panic. When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity. However, the conception did not come to him in such terms. His idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself, running around like a chicken with its head cut off--such was the simile that occurred to him. Well, he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it decently. With this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness. A good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death. It was like taking an anaesthetic. Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were lots worse ways to die.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He pictured the boys finding his body next day. Suddenly he found himself with them, coming along the trail and looking for himself. And, still with them, he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the snow. He did not belong with himself any more, for even then he was out of himself, standing with the boys and looking at himself in the snow. It certainly was cold, was his thought. When he got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold was. He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek. He could see him quite clearly, warm and comfortable, and smoking a pipe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You were right, old hoss; you were right," the man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known. The dog sat facing him and waiting. The brief day drew to a close in a long, slow twilight. There were no signs of a fire to be made, and, besides, never in the dog\'s experience had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire. As the twilight drew on, its eager yearning for the fire mastered it, and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet, it whined softly, then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man. But the man remained silent. Later, the dog whined loudly. And still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death. This made the animal bristle and back away. A little longer it delayed, howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky. Then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew, where were the other food-providers and fire-providers.</p>', 'To Build a Fire', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'to-build-a-fire', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:09:55', '2015-12-03 08:09:55', '', '0', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=27', '0', 'post', '', '0' );

It was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o\'clock. There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the absence of sun. This fact did not worry the man. He was used to the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky- line and dip immediately from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce- covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hair-line was the trail--the main trail--that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But all this--the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all--made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man\'s frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man\'s place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As he turned to go on, he spat speculatively. There was a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him. He spat again. And again, in the air, before it could fall to the snow, the spittle crackled. He knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had crackled in the air. Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below--how much colder he did not know. But the temperature did not matter. He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where the boys were already. They had come over across the divide from the Indian Creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the Yukon. He would be in to camp by six o\'clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper would be ready. As for lunch, he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket. It was also under his shirt, wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin. It was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing. He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm-whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the man\'s heels trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man\'s judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man\'s brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man\'s heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle, and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man\'s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly, the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing with every warm, moist breath he exhaled. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did not mind the appendage. It was the penalty all tobacco- chewers paid in that country, and he had been out before in two cold snaps. They had not been so cold as this, he knew, but by the spirit thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles, crossed a wide flat of nigger-heads, and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek, and he knew he was ten miles from the forks. He looked at his watch. It was ten o\'clock. He was making four miles an hour, and he calculated that he would arrive at the forks at half-past twelve. He decided to celebrate that event by eating his lunch there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dog dropped in again at his heels, with a tail drooping discouragement, as the man swung along the creek-bed. The furrow of the old sled-trail was plainly visible, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners. In a month no man had come up or down that silent creek. The man held steadily on. He was not much given to thinking, and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o\'clock he would be in camp with the boys. There was nobody to talk to and, had there been, speech would have been impossible because of the ice-muzzle on his mouth. So he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber beard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his cheek-bones and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this automatically, now and again changing hands. But rub as he would, the instant he stopped his cheek-bones went numb, and the following instant the end of his nose went numb. He was sure to frost his cheeks; he knew that, and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps. Such a strap passed across the cheeks, as well, and saved them. But it didn\'t matter much, after all. What were frosted cheeks? A bit painful, that was all; they were never serious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Empty as the man\'s mind was of thoughts, he was keenly observant, and he noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and bends and timber- jams, and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around a bend, he shied abruptly, like a startled horse, curved away from the place where he had been walking, and retreated several paces back along the trail. The creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom--no creek could contain water in that arctic winter--but he knew also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice of the creek. He knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their danger. They were traps. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there were alternate layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes wetting himself to the waist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was why he had shied in such panic. He had felt the give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden ice-skin. And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, for he would be forced to stop and build a fire, and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins. He stood and studied the creek-bed and its banks, and decided that the flow of water came from the right. He reflected awhile, rubbing his nose and cheeks, then skirted to the left, stepping gingerly and testing the footing for each step. Once clear of the danger, he took a fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps. Usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken, candied appearance that advertised the danger. Once again, however, he had a close call; and once, suspecting danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front. The dog did not want to go. It hung back until the man shoved it forward, and then it went quickly across the white, unbroken surface. Suddenly it broke through, floundered to one side, and got away to firmer footing. It had wet its forefeet and legs, and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice. It made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs, then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had formed between the toes. This was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet. It did not know this. It merely obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being. But the man knew, having achieved a judgment on the subject, and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the ice- particles. He did not expose his fingers more than a minute, and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them. It certainly was cold. He pulled on the mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At twelve o\'clock the day was at its brightest. Yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the horizon. The bulge of the earth intervened between it and Henderson Creek, where the man walked under a clear sky at noon and cast no shadow. At half-past twelve, to the minute, he arrived at the forks of the creek. He was pleased at the speed he had made. If he kept it up, he would certainly be with the boys by six. He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch. The action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers. He did not put the mitten on, but, instead, struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against his leg. Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat. The sting that followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled, he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit. He struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten, baring the other hand for the purpose of eating. He tried to take a mouthful, but the ice-muzzle prevented. He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. He chuckled at his foolishness, and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers. Also, he noted that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already passing away. He wondered whether the toes were warm or numbed. He moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numbed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up. He was a bit frightened. He stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet. It certainly was cold, was his thought. That man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country. And he had laughed at him at the time! That showed one must not be too sure of things. There was no mistake about it, it was cold. He strode up and down, stamping his feet and threshing his arms, until reassured by the returning warmth. Then he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire. From the undergrowth, where high water of the previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his firewood. Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring fire, over which he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits. For the moment the cold of space was outwitted. The dog took satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the man had finished, he filled his pipe and took his comfortable time over a smoke. Then he pulled on his mittens, settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears, and took the creek trail up the left fork. The dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire. This man did not know cold. Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold, of real cold, of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point. But the dog knew; all its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the knowledge. And it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful cold. It was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer space whence this cold came. On the other hand, there was keen intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other, and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip- lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. So the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man. It was not concerned in the welfare of the man; it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire. But the man whistled, and spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes, and the dog swung in at the man\'s heels and followed after.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard. Also, his moist breath quickly powdered with white his moustache, eyebrows, and lashes. There did not seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the Henderson, and for half an hour the man saw no signs of any. And then it happened. At a place where there were no signs, where the soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath, the man broke through. It was not deep. He wetted himself half-way to the knees before he floundered out to the firm crust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was angry, and cursed his luck aloud. He had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o\'clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he would have to build a fire and dry out his foot-gear. This was imperative at that low temperature--he knew that much; and he turned aside to the bank, which he climbed. On top, tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water deposit of dry firewood--sticks and twigs principally, but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine, dry, last-year\'s grasses. He threw down several large pieces on top of the snow. This served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt. The flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket. This burned even more readily than paper. Placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his danger. Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it. He squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy- five below zero, a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire--that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this the man knew. The old-timer on Sulphur Creek had told him about it the previous fall, and now he was appreciating the advice. Already all sensation had gone out of his feet. To build the fire he had been forced to remove his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb. His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the surface of his body and to all the extremities. But the instant he stopped, the action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold. So long as he walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly, to the surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body. The extremities were the first to feel its absence. His wet feet froze the faster, and his exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they had not yet begun to freeze. Nose and cheeks were already freezing, while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But he was safe. Toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the frost, for the fire was beginning to burn with strength. He was feeding it with twigs the size of his finger. In another minute he would be able to feed it with branches the size of his wrist, and then he could remove his wet foot-gear, and, while it dried, he could keep his naked feet warm by the fire, rubbing them at first, of course, with snow. The fire was a success. He was safe. He remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek, and smiled. The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below. Well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he had saved himself. Those old-timers were rather womanish, some of them, he thought. All a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all right. Any man who was a man could travel alone. But it was surprising, the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing. And he had not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time. Lifeless they were, for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig, and they seemed remote from his body and from him. When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it. The wires were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of which counted for little. There was the fire, snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame. He started to untie his moccasins. They were coated with ice; the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron half-way to the knees; and the mocassin strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration. For a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the folly of it, he drew his sheath-knife.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But before he could cut the strings, it happened. It was his own fault or, rather, his mistake. He should not have built the fire under the spruce tree. He should have built it in the open. But it had been easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the fire. Now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs. No wind had blown for weeks, and each bough was fully freighted. Each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight agitation to the tree--an imperceptible agitation, so far as he was concerned, but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster. High up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow. This fell on the boughs beneath, capsizing them. This process continued, spreading out and involving the whole tree. It grew like an avalanche, and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire, and the fire was blotted out! Where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man was shocked. It was as though he had just heard his own sentence of death. For a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been. Then he grew very calm. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right. If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have built the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire over again, and this second time there must be no failure. Even if he succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes. His feet must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before the second fire was ready.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such were his thoughts, but he did not sit and think them. He was busy all the time they were passing through his mind, he made a new foundation for a fire, this time in the open; where no treacherous tree could blot it out. Next, he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water flotsam. He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out, but he was able to gather them by the handful. In this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable, but it was the best he could do. He worked methodically, even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength. And all the while the dog sat and watched him, a certain yearning wistfulness in its eyes, for it looked upon him as the fire-provider, and the fire was slow in coming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When all was ready, the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it. Try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended to put him in a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a time he was aware of the first far-away signals of sensation in his beaten fingers. The faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was excruciating, but which the man hailed with satisfaction. He stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the birch-bark. The exposed fingers were quickly going numb again. Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches. But the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers. In his effort to separate one match from the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow. He tried to pick it out of the snow, but failed. The dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch. He was very careful. He drove the thought of his freezing feet; and nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his whole soul to the matches. He watched, using the sense of vision in place of that of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch, he closed them--that is, he willed to close them, for the wires were drawn, and the fingers did not obey. He pulled the mitten on the right hand, and beat it fiercely against his knee. Then, with both mittened hands, he scooped the bunch of matches, along with much snow, into his lap. Yet he was no better off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands. In this fashion he carried it to his mouth. The ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth. He drew the lower jaw in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match. He succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap. He was no better off. He could not pick it up. Then he devised a way. He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg. Twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it. As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark. But the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically. The match fell into the snow and went out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right, he thought in the moment of controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel with a partner. He beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation. Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth. He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands. His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at once! There was no wind to blow them out. He kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He could smell it. Deep down below the surface he could feel it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his hands apart. The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but the birch-bark was alight. He began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame. He could not pick and choose, for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his hands. Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth. He cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly. It meant life, and it must not perish. The withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him begin to shiver, and he grew more awkward. A large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little fire. He tried to poke it out with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him poke too far, and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire, the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering. He tried to poke them together again, but in spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with him, and the twigs were hopelessly scattered. Each twig gushed a puff of smoke and went out. The fire-provider had failed. As he looked apathetically about him, his eyes chanced on the dog, sitting across the ruins of the fire from him, in the snow, making restless, hunching movements, slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other, shifting its weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head. He remembered the tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed a steer and crawled inside the carcass, and so was saved. He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them. Then he could build another fire. He spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal, who had never known the man to speak in such way before. Something was the matter, and its suspicious nature sensed danger,--it knew not what danger but somewhere, somehow, in its brain arose an apprehension of the man. It flattened its ears down at the sound of the man\'s voice, and its restless, hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man. He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog. This unusual posture again excited suspicion, and the animal sidled mincingly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness. Then he pulled on his mittens, by means of his teeth, and got upon his feet. He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth. His erect position in itself started to drive the webs of suspicion from the dog\'s mind; and when he spoke peremptorily, with the sound of whip-lashes in his voice, the dog rendered its customary allegiance and came to him. As it came within reaching distance, the man lost his control. His arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers. He had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more. All this happened quickly, and before the animal could get away, he encircled its body with his arms. He sat down in the snow, and in this fashion held the dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But it was all he could do, hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there. He realized that he could not kill the dog. There was no way to do it. With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor throttle the animal. He released it, and it plunged wildly away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling. It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked forward. The man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of his arms. It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were. He began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides. He did this for five minutes, violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering. But no sensation was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him. This threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old, dim trail. The dog joined in behind and kept up with him. He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his life. Slowly, as he ploughed and floundered through the snow, he began to see things again--the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the leafless aspens, and the sky. The running made him feel better. He did not shiver. Maybe, if he ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway, if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys. Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there. And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it was too many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff and dead. This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider. Sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard, but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body. He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no connection with the earth. Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury, and he wondered if Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it: he lacked the endurance. Several times he stumbled, and finally he tottered, crumpled up, and fell. When he tried to rise, he failed. He must sit and rest, he decided, and next time he would merely walk and keep on going. As he sat and regained his breath, he noted that he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He was not shivering, and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk. And yet, when he touched his nose or cheeks, there was no sensation. Running would not thaw them out. Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. Then the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be extending. He tried to keep this thought down, to forget it, to think of something else; he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused, and he was afraid of the panic. But the thought asserted itself, and persisted, until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen. This was too much, and he made another wild run along the trail. Once he slowed down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending itself made him run again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels. When he fell down a second time, it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and intent. The warmth and security of the animal angered him, and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly. This time the shivering came more quickly upon the man. He was losing in his battle with the frost. It was creeping into his body from all sides. The thought of it drove him on, but he ran no more than a hundred feet, when he staggered and pitched headlong. It was his last panic. When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity. However, the conception did not come to him in such terms. His idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself, running around like a chicken with its head cut off--such was the simile that occurred to him. Well, he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it decently. With this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness. A good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death. It was like taking an anaesthetic. Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were lots worse ways to die.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He pictured the boys finding his body next day. Suddenly he found himself with them, coming along the trail and looking for himself. And, still with them, he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the snow. He did not belong with himself any more, for even then he was out of himself, standing with the boys and looking at himself in the snow. It certainly was cold, was his thought. When he got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold was. He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek. He could see him quite clearly, warm and comfortable, and smoking a pipe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You were right, old hoss; you were right," the man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known. The dog sat facing him and waiting. The brief day drew to a close in a long, slow twilight. There were no signs of a fire to be made, and, besides, never in the dog\'s experience had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire. As the twilight drew on, its eager yearning for the fire mastered it, and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet, it whined softly, then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man. But the man remained silent. Later, the dog whined loudly. And still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death. This made the animal bristle and back away. A little longer it delayed, howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky. Then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew, where were the other food-providers and fire-providers.</p>', 'To Build a Fire', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '27-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:09:55', '2015-12-03 08:09:55', '', '27', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=28', '0', 'revision', '', '0' );

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>I</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man\'s hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck. It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the sleepers supporting the metals of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as "support," that is to say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it. Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle acclivity topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the bridge. Midway of the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at "parade rest," the butts of the rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right. Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter. His features were good--a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well-fitting frock coat. He wore a mustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgment as simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged. He looked a moment at his "unsteadfast footing," then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it appeared to move, What a sluggish stream!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him. And now he became conscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his dear ones was a sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith\'s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--it seemed both. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He awaited each stroke with impatience and--he knew not why--apprehension. The intervals of silence grew progressively longer, the delays became maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. "If I could free my hands," he thought, "I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond the invader\'s farthest advance."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man\'s brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>II</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peyton Farquhar was a well-to-do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking service with the gallant army that had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That opportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in war time. Meanwhile he did what he could. No service was too humble for him to perform in aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The Yanks are repairing the railroads," said the man, "and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?" Farquhar asked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"About thirty miles."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Is there no force on this side the creek?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel," said Farquhar, smiling, "what could he accomplish?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The soldier reflected. "I was there a month ago," he replied. "I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>III</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well-defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fulness--of congestion. These sensations were unaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. "To be hanged and drowned," he thought? "that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome. What splendid effort!--what magnificent, what superhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake. "Put it back, put it back!" He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire; his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant-bodied flies, the grey spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies\' wings, the strokes of the water-spiders\' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in silhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a grey eye and remembered having read that grey eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was again looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning\'s work. How coldly and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquillity in the men--with what accurately measured intervals fell those cruel words:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Attention, company! . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready! . . . Aim! . . . Fire!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther down stream nearer to safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The officer," he reasoned, "will not make that martinet\'s error a second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has probably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I cannot dodge them all!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, diminuendo, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the game. As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"They will not do that again," he thought; "the next time they will use a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile. That is a good gun."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top. The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men--all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color--that was all he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream--the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange, roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of olian harps. He had no wish to perfect his escape--was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman\'s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a region. There was something uncanny in the revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of his wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great garden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue--he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene--perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forward with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon--then all is darkness and silence!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.</p>', 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'an-occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:22:00', '2015-12-03 08:22:00', '', '0', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=29', '0', 'post', '', '0' );

Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The Yanks are repairing the railroads," said the man, "and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?" Farquhar asked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"About thirty miles."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Is there no force on this side the creek?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel," said Farquhar, smiling, "what could he accomplish?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The soldier reflected. "I was there a month ago," he replied. "I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>III</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well-defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fulness--of congestion. These sensations were unaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. "To be hanged and drowned," he thought? "that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome. What splendid effort!--what magnificent, what superhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake. "Put it back, put it back!" He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire; his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant-bodied flies, the grey spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies\' wings, the strokes of the water-spiders\' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in silhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a grey eye and remembered having read that grey eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was again looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning\'s work. How coldly and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquillity in the men--with what accurately measured intervals fell those cruel words:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Attention, company! . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready! . . . Aim! . . . Fire!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther down stream nearer to safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The officer," he reasoned, "will not make that martinet\'s error a second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has probably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I cannot dodge them all!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, diminuendo, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the game. As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"They will not do that again," he thought; "the next time they will use a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile. That is a good gun."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top. The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men--all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color--that was all he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream--the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange, roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of olian harps. He had no wish to perfect his escape--was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman\'s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a region. There was something uncanny in the revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of his wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great garden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue--he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene--perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forward with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon--then all is darkness and silence!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.</p>', 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:11:38', '2015-12-03 08:11:38', '', '29', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=31', '0', 'revision', '', '0' );

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>"Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it."</i> --</b>Anonymous</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Part I</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Hark at the wind," said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I\'m listening," said the latter grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. "Check."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I should hardly think that he\'s come tonight, " said his father, with his hand poised over the board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Mate," replied the son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"That\'s the worst of living so far out," balled Mr. White with sudden and unlooked-for violence; "Of all the beastly, slushy, out of the way places to live in, this is the worst. Path\'s a bog, and the road\'s a torrent. I don\'t know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn\'t matter."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Never mind, dear," said his wife soothingly; "perhaps you\'ll win the next one."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. the words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"There he is," said Herbert White as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, "Tut, tut!" and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Sargeant-Major Morris, " he said, introducing him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sargeant-Major took hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Twenty-one years of it," said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. "When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"He don\'t look to have taken much harm." said Mrs. White politely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I\'d like to go to India myself," said the old man, just to look around a bit, you know."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Better where you are," said the Sargeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighning softly, shook it again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers," said the old man. "what was that that you started telling me the other day about a monkey\'s paw or something, Morris?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Nothing." said the soldier hastily. "Leastways, nothing worth hearing."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Monkey\'s paw?" said Mrs. White curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, it\'s just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps." said the Sargeant-Major off-handedly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"To look at," said the Sargeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, "it\'s just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"And what is there special about it?" inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It had a spell put on it by an old Fakir," said the Sargeant-Major, "a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people\'s lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His manners were so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, why don\'t you have three, sir?" said Herbert White cleverly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth."I have," he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"And did you really have the three wishes granted?" asked Mrs. White.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I did," said the seargent-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"And has anybody else wished?" persisted the old lady.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The first man had his three wishes. Yes, " was the reply, "I don\'t know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That\'s how I got the paw."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you\'ve had your three wishes it\'s no good to you now then Morris," said the old man at last. "What do you keep it for?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The soldier shook his head. "Fancy I suppose," he said slowly." I did have some idea of selling it, but I don\'t think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won\'t buy. They think it\'s a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you could have another three wishes," said the old man, eyeing him keenly," would you have them?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I don\'t know," said the other. "I don\'t know."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Better let it burn," said the soldier solemnly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you don\'t want it Morris," said the other, "give it to me."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I won\'t." said his friend doggedly. "I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don\'t blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other shook his head and examined his possession closely. "How do you do it?" he inquired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Hold it up in your right hand, and wish aloud," said the Sargeant-Major, "But I warn you of the consequences."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Sounds like the \'Arabian Nights\'", said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. "Don\'t you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Seargent-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you must wish," he said gruffly, "Wish for something sensible."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second installment of the soldier\'s adventures in India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If the tale about the monkey\'s paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us," said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, "we shan\'t make much out of it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Did you give anything for it, father?" inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"A trifle," said he, colouring slightly, "He didn\'t want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Likely," said Herbert, with pretended horror. "Why, we\'re going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can\'t be henpecked."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He darted around the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs White armed with an antimacassar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. "I don\'t know what to wish for, and that\'s a fact," he said slowly. It seems to me I\'ve got all I want."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you only cleared the house, you\'d be quite happy, wouldn\'t you!" said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. "Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that\'ll just do it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I wish for two hundred pounds," said the old man distinctly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It moved," he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. "As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, I don\'t see the money," said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, "and I bet I never shall."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It must have been your fancy, father," said his wife, regarding him anxiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He shook his head. "Never mind, though; there\'s no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, an the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I expect you\'ll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed," said Herbert, as he bade them good night, " and something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey\'s paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Part II</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shriveled little paw was pitched on the side-board with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I suppose all old soldiers are the same," said Mrs White. "The idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Might drop on his head from the sky," said the frivolous Herbert.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Morris said the things happened so naturally," said his father, "that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well don\'t break into the money before I come back," said Herbert as he rose from the table. "I\'m afraid it\'ll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband\'s credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman\'s knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sargeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor\'s bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home," she said as they sat at dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I dare say," said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; "but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I\'ll swear to."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You thought it did," said the old lady soothingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I say it did," replied the other. "There was no thought about it; I had just - What\'s the matter?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband\'s coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I - was asked to call," he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. "I come from \'Maw and Meggins.\' "</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old lady started. "Is anything the matter?" she asked breathlessly. "Has anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her husband interposed. "There there mother," he said hastily. "Sit down, and don\'t jump to conclusions. You\'ve not brought bad news, I\'m sure sir," and eyed the other wistfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I\'m sorry - " began the visitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Is he hurt?" demanded the mother wildly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The visitor bowed in assent."Badly hurt," he said quietly, "but he is not in any pain."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Oh thank God!" said the old woman, clasping her hands. "Thank God for that! Thank - "</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the others averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"He was caught in the machinery," said the visitor at length in a low voice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Caught in the machinery," repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion,"yes."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He sat staring out the window, and taking his wife\'s hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"He was the only one left to us," he said, turning gently to the visitor. "It is hard."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. " The firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss," he said, without looking round. "I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was no reply; the old woman’s face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband\'s face was a look such as his friend the sargeant might have carried into his first action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility," continued the other. "They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son\'s services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White dropped his wife\'s hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, "How much?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Two hundred pounds," was the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unconscious of his wife\'s shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Part III</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen - something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the days passed, and expectations gave way to resignation - the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes mis-called apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Come back," he said tenderly. "You will be cold."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It is colder for my son," said the old woman, and wept afresh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"THE PAW!" she cried wildly. "THE MONKEY\'S PAW!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He started up in alarm. "Where? Where is it? What’s the matter?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She came stumbling across the room toward him. "I want it," she said quietly. "You\'ve not destroyed it?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It\'s in the parlour, on the bracket," he replied, marveling. "Why?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I only just thought of it," she said hysterically. "Why didn\'t I think of it before? Why didn\'t you think of it?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Think of what?" he questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The other two wishes," she replied rapidly. "We\'ve only had one."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Was not that enough?" he demanded fiercely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"No," she cried triumphantly; "We\'ll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs."Good God, you are mad!" he cried aghast. "Get it," she panted; "get it quickly, and wish - Oh my boy, my boy!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. "Get back to bed he said unsteadily. "You don\'t know what you are saying."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We had the first wish granted," said the old woman, feverishly; "why not the second?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"A coincidence," stammered the old man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Go get it and wish," cried his wife, quivering with excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. "He has been dead ten days, and besides he - I would not tell you else, but - I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Bring him back," cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. "Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantlepiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized up on him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even his wife\'s face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"WISH!" she cried in a strong voice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It is foolish and wicked," he faltered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"WISH!" repeated his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He raised his hand. "I wish my son alive again."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neither spoke, but lat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock came so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>"WHAT’S THAT?"</em> cried the old woman, starting up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"A rat," said the old man in shaking tones - "a rat. It passed me on the stairs."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It\'s Herbert!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"What are you going to do?" he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It\'s my boy; it\'s Herbert!" she cried, struggling mechanically. "I forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"For God\'s sake don\'t let it in," cried the old man, trembling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You\'re afraid of your own son," she cried struggling. "Let me go. I\'m coming, Herbert; I\'m coming."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman’s voice, strained and panting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The bolt," she cried loudly. "Come down. I can\'t reach it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated throgh the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey\'s paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road.</p>', 'The Monkey\'s Paw', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-monkeys-paw', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:23:34', '2015-12-03 08:23:34', '', '0', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=32', '0', 'post', '', '0' );

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>"Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it."</i> --</b>Anonymous</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Part I</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Hark at the wind," said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I\'m listening," said the latter grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. "Check."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I should hardly think that he\'s come tonight, " said his father, with his hand poised over the board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Mate," replied the son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"That\'s the worst of living so far out," balled Mr. White with sudden and unlooked-for violence; "Of all the beastly, slushy, out of the way places to live in, this is the worst. Path\'s a bog, and the road\'s a torrent. I don\'t know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn\'t matter."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Never mind, dear," said his wife soothingly; "perhaps you\'ll win the next one."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. the words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"There he is," said Herbert White as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, "Tut, tut!" and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Sargeant-Major Morris, " he said, introducing him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sargeant-Major took hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Twenty-one years of it," said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. "When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"He don\'t look to have taken much harm." said Mrs. White politely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I\'d like to go to India myself," said the old man, just to look around a bit, you know."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Better where you are," said the Sargeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighning softly, shook it again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers," said the old man. "what was that that you started telling me the other day about a monkey\'s paw or something, Morris?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Nothing." said the soldier hastily. "Leastways, nothing worth hearing."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Monkey\'s paw?" said Mrs. White curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, it\'s just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps." said the Sargeant-Major off-handedly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"To look at," said the Sargeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, "it\'s just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"And what is there special about it?" inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It had a spell put on it by an old Fakir," said the Sargeant-Major, "a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people\'s lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His manners were so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, why don\'t you have three, sir?" said Herbert White cleverly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth."I have," he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"And did you really have the three wishes granted?" asked Mrs. White.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I did," said the seargent-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"And has anybody else wished?" persisted the old lady.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The first man had his three wishes. Yes, " was the reply, "I don\'t know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That\'s how I got the paw."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you\'ve had your three wishes it\'s no good to you now then Morris," said the old man at last. "What do you keep it for?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The soldier shook his head. "Fancy I suppose," he said slowly." I did have some idea of selling it, but I don\'t think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won\'t buy. They think it\'s a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you could have another three wishes," said the old man, eyeing him keenly," would you have them?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I don\'t know," said the other. "I don\'t know."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Better let it burn," said the soldier solemnly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you don\'t want it Morris," said the other, "give it to me."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I won\'t." said his friend doggedly. "I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don\'t blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other shook his head and examined his possession closely. "How do you do it?" he inquired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Hold it up in your right hand, and wish aloud," said the Sargeant-Major, "But I warn you of the consequences."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Sounds like the \'Arabian Nights\'", said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. "Don\'t you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Seargent-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you must wish," he said gruffly, "Wish for something sensible."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second installment of the soldier\'s adventures in India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If the tale about the monkey\'s paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us," said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, "we shan\'t make much out of it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Did you give anything for it, father?" inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"A trifle," said he, colouring slightly, "He didn\'t want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Likely," said Herbert, with pretended horror. "Why, we\'re going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can\'t be henpecked."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He darted around the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs White armed with an antimacassar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. "I don\'t know what to wish for, and that\'s a fact," he said slowly. It seems to me I\'ve got all I want."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If you only cleared the house, you\'d be quite happy, wouldn\'t you!" said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. "Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that\'ll just do it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I wish for two hundred pounds," said the old man distinctly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It moved," he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. "As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, I don\'t see the money," said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, "and I bet I never shall."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It must have been your fancy, father," said his wife, regarding him anxiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He shook his head. "Never mind, though; there\'s no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, an the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I expect you\'ll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed," said Herbert, as he bade them good night, " and something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey\'s paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Part II</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shriveled little paw was pitched on the side-board with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I suppose all old soldiers are the same," said Mrs White. "The idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Might drop on his head from the sky," said the frivolous Herbert.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Morris said the things happened so naturally," said his father, "that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well don\'t break into the money before I come back," said Herbert as he rose from the table. "I\'m afraid it\'ll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband\'s credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman\'s knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sargeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor\'s bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home," she said as they sat at dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I dare say," said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; "but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I\'ll swear to."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You thought it did," said the old lady soothingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I say it did," replied the other. "There was no thought about it; I had just - What\'s the matter?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband\'s coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I - was asked to call," he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. "I come from \'Maw and Meggins.\' "</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old lady started. "Is anything the matter?" she asked breathlessly. "Has anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her husband interposed. "There there mother," he said hastily. "Sit down, and don\'t jump to conclusions. You\'ve not brought bad news, I\'m sure sir," and eyed the other wistfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I\'m sorry - " began the visitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Is he hurt?" demanded the mother wildly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The visitor bowed in assent."Badly hurt," he said quietly, "but he is not in any pain."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Oh thank God!" said the old woman, clasping her hands. "Thank God for that! Thank - "</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the others averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"He was caught in the machinery," said the visitor at length in a low voice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Caught in the machinery," repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion,"yes."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He sat staring out the window, and taking his wife\'s hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"He was the only one left to us," he said, turning gently to the visitor. "It is hard."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. " The firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss," he said, without looking round. "I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was no reply; the old woman’s face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband\'s face was a look such as his friend the sargeant might have carried into his first action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility," continued the other. "They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son\'s services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. White dropped his wife\'s hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, "How much?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Two hundred pounds," was the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unconscious of his wife\'s shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Part III</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen - something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the days passed, and expectations gave way to resignation - the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes mis-called apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Come back," he said tenderly. "You will be cold."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It is colder for my son," said the old woman, and wept afresh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"THE PAW!" she cried wildly. "THE MONKEY\'S PAW!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He started up in alarm. "Where? Where is it? What’s the matter?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She came stumbling across the room toward him. "I want it," she said quietly. "You\'ve not destroyed it?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It\'s in the parlour, on the bracket," he replied, marveling. "Why?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I only just thought of it," she said hysterically. "Why didn\'t I think of it before? Why didn\'t you think of it?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Think of what?" he questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The other two wishes," she replied rapidly. "We\'ve only had one."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Was not that enough?" he demanded fiercely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"No," she cried triumphantly; "We\'ll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs."Good God, you are mad!" he cried aghast. "Get it," she panted; "get it quickly, and wish - Oh my boy, my boy!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. "Get back to bed he said unsteadily. "You don\'t know what you are saying."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We had the first wish granted," said the old woman, feverishly; "why not the second?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"A coincidence," stammered the old man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Go get it and wish," cried his wife, quivering with excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. "He has been dead ten days, and besides he - I would not tell you else, but - I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Bring him back," cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. "Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantlepiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized up on him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even his wife\'s face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"WISH!" she cried in a strong voice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It is foolish and wicked," he faltered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"WISH!" repeated his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He raised his hand. "I wish my son alive again."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neither spoke, but lat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock came so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>"WHAT’S THAT?"</em> cried the old woman, starting up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"A rat," said the old man in shaking tones - "a rat. It passed me on the stairs."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It\'s Herbert!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"What are you going to do?" he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It\'s my boy; it\'s Herbert!" she cried, struggling mechanically. "I forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"For God\'s sake don\'t let it in," cried the old man, trembling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You\'re afraid of your own son," she cried struggling. "Let me go. I\'m coming, Herbert; I\'m coming."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman’s voice, strained and panting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The bolt," she cried loudly. "Come down. I can\'t reach it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated throgh the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey\'s paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road.</p>', 'The Monkey\'s Paw', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '32-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-12-03 08:13:31', '2015-12-03 08:13:31', '', '32', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=34', '0', 'revision', '', '0' );

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was commotion in Roaring Camp. It could not have been a fight, for in 1850 that was not novel enough to have called together the entire settlement. The ditches and claims were not only deserted, but "Tuttle\'s grocery" had contributed its gamblers, who, it will be remembered, calmly continued their game the day that French Pete and Kanaka Joe shot each other to death over the bar in the front room. The whole camp was collected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing. Conversation was carried on in a low tone, but the name of a woman was frequently repeated. It was a name familiar enough in the camp,--"Cherokee Sal."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the less said of her the better. She was a coarse and, it is to be feared, a very sinful woman. But at that time she was the only woman in Roaring Camp, and was just then lying in sore extremity, when she most needed the ministration of her own sex. Dissolute, abandoned, and irreclaimable, she was yet suffering a martyrdom hard enough to bear even when veiled by sympathizing womanhood, but now terrible in her loneliness. The primal curse had come to her in that original isolation which must have made the punishment of the first transgression so dreadful. It was, perhaps, part of the expiation of her sin that, at a moment when she most lacked her sex\'s intuitive tenderness and care, she met only the half-contemptuous faces of her masculine associates. Yet a few of the spectators were, I think, touched by her sufferings. Sandy Tipton thought it was "rough on Sal," and, in the contemplation of her condition, for a moment rose superior to the fact that he had an ace and two bowers in his sleeve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will be seen also that the situation was novel. Deaths were by no means uncommon in Roaring Camp, but a birth was a new thing. People had been dismissed the camp effectively, finally, and with no possibility of return; but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced AB INITIO. Hence the excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You go in there, Stumpy," said a prominent citizen known as "Kentuck," addressing one of the loungers. "Go in there, and see what you kin do. You\'ve had experience in them things."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection. Stumpy, in other climes, had been the putative head of two families; in fact, it was owing to some legal informality in these proceedings that Roaring Camp--a city of refuge--was indebted to his company. The crowd approved the choice, and Stumpy was wise enough to bow to the majority. The door closed on the extempore surgeon and midwife, and Roaring Camp sat down outside, smoked its pipe, and awaited the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assemblage numbered about a hundred men. One or two of these were actual fugitives from justice, some were criminal, and all were reckless. Physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives and character. The greatest scamp had a Raphael face, with a profusion of blonde hair; Oakhurst, a gambler, had the melancholy air and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet; the coolest and most courageous man was scarcely over five feet in height, with a soft voice and an embarrassed, timid manner. The term "roughs" applied to them was a distinction rather than a definition. Perhaps in the minor details of fingers, toes, ears, etc., the camp may have been deficient, but these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force. The strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand; the best shot had but one eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed around the cabin. The camp lay in a triangular valley between two hills and a river. The only outlet was a steep trail over the summit of a hill that faced the cabin, now illuminated by the rising moon. The suffering woman might have seen it from the rude bunk whereon she lay,--seen it winding like a silver thread until it was lost in the stars above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gathering. By degrees the natural levity of Roaring Camp returned. Bets were freely offered and taken regarding the result. Three to five that "Sal would get through with it;" even that the child would survive; side bets as to the sex and complexion of the coming stranger. In the midst of an excited discussion an exclamation came from those nearest the door, and the camp stopped to listen. Above the swaying and moaning of the pines, the swift rush of the river, and the crackling of the fire rose a sharp, querulous cry,--a cry unlike anything heard before in the camp. The pines stopped moaning, the river ceased to rush, and the fire to crackle. It seemed as if Nature had stopped to listen too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The camp rose to its feet as one man! It was proposed to explode a barrel of gunpowder; but in consideration of the situation of the mother, better counsels prevailed, and only a few revolvers were discharged; for whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp, or some other reason, Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had climbed, as it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so passed out of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame, forever. I do not think that the announcement disturbed them much, except in speculation as to the fate of the child. "Can he live now?" was asked of Stumpy. The answer was doubtful. The only other being of Cherokee Sal\'s sex and maternal condition in the settlement was an ass. There was some conjecture as to fitness, but the experiment was tried. It was less problematical than the ancient treatment of Romulus and Remus, and apparently as successful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When these details were completed, which exhausted another hour, the door was opened, and the anxious crowd of men, who had already formed themselves into a queue, entered in single file. Beside the low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly outlined below the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a candle- box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp. Beside the candle-box was placed a hat. Its use was soon indicated. "Gentlemen," said Stumpy, with a singular mixture of authority and EX OFFICIO complacency,-- "gentlemen will please pass in at the front door, round the table, and out at the back door. Them as wishes to contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy." The first man entered with his hat on; he uncovered, however, as he looked about him, and so unconsciously set an example to the next. In such communities good and bad actions are catching. As the procession filed in comments were audible,--criticisms addressed perhaps rather to Stumpy in the character of showman; "Is that him?" "Mighty small specimen;" "Has n\'t more \'n got the color;" "Ain\'t bigger nor a derringer." The contributions were as characteristic: A silver tobacco box; a doubloon; a navy revolver, silver mounted; a gold specimen; a very beautifully embroidered lady\'s handkerchief (from Oakhurst the gambler); a diamond breastpin; a diamond ring (suggested by the pin, with the remark from the giver that he "saw that pin and went two diamonds better"); a slung-shot; a Bible (contributor not detected); a golden spur; a silver teaspoon (the initials, I regret to say, were not the giver\'s); a pair of surgeon\'s shears; a lancet; a Bank of England note for 5 pounds; and about $200 in loose gold and silver coin. During these proceedings Stumpy maintained a silence as impassive as the dead on his left, a gravity as inscrutable as that of the newly born on his right. Only one incident occurred to break the monotony of the curious procession. As Kentuck bent over the candle-box half curiously, the child turned, and, in a spasm of pain, caught at his groping finger, and held it fast for a moment. Kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed. Something like a blush tried to assert itself in his weather-beaten cheek. "The damned little cuss!" he said, as he extricated his finger, with perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed capable of showing. He held that finger a little apart from its fellows as he went out, and examined it curiously. The examination provoked the same original remark in regard to the child. In fact, he seemed to enjoy repeating it. "He rastled with my finger," he remarked to Tipton, holding up the member, "the damned little cuss!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was four o\'clock before the camp sought repose. A light burnt in the cabin where the watchers sat, for Stumpy did not go to bed that night. Nor did Kentuck. He drank quite freely, and related with great gusto his experience, invariably ending with his characteristic condemnation of the newcomer. It seemed to relieve him of any unjust implication of sentiment, and Kentuck had the weaknesses of the nobler sex. When everybody else had gone to bed, he walked down to the river and whistled reflectingly. Then he walked up the gulch past the cabin, still whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood-tree he paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin. Halfway down to the river\'s bank he again paused, and then returned and knocked at the door. It was opened by Stumpy. "How goes it?" said Kentuck, looking past Stumpy toward the candle-box. "All serene!" replied Stumpy. "Anything up?" "Nothing." There was a pause--an embarrassing one--Stumpy still holding the door. Then Kentuck had recourse to his finger, which he held up to Stumpy. "Rastled with it,--the damned little cuss," he said, and retired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next day Cherokee Sal had such rude sepulture as Roaring Camp afforded. After her body had been committed to the hillside, there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her infant. A resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic. But an animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at once sprang up. It was remarkable that the argument partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were usually conducted at Roaring Camp. Tipton proposed that they should send the child to Red Dog,--a distance of forty miles,--where female attention could be procured. But the unlucky suggestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition. It was evident that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained. "Besides," said Tom Ryder, "them fellows at Red Dog would swap it, and ring in somebody else on us." A disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed at Roaring Camp, as in other places.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with objection. It was argued that no decent woman could be prevailed to accept Roaring Camp as her home, and the speaker urged that "they didn\'t want any more of the other kind." This unkind allusion to the defunct mother, harsh as it may seem, was the first spasm of propriety,--the first symptom of the camp\'s regeneration. Stumpy advanced nothing. Perhaps he felt a certain delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible successor in office. But when questioned, he averred stoutly that he and "Jinny"--the mammal before alluded to--could manage to rear the child. There was something original, independent, and heroic about the plan that pleased the camp. Stumpy was retained. Certain articles were sent for to Sacramento. "Mind," said the treasurer, as he pressed a bag of gold-dust into the expressman\'s hand, "the best that can be got,--lace, you know, and filigree-work and frills,--damn the cost!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Strange to say, the child thrived. Perhaps the invigorating climate of the mountain camp was compensation for material deficiencies. Nature took the foundling to her broader breast. In that rare atmosphere of the Sierra foothills,--that air pungent with balsamic odor, that ethereal cordial at once bracing and exhilarating,--he may have found food and nourishment, or a subtle chemistry that transmuted ass\'s milk to lime and phosphorus. Stumpy inclined to the belief that it was the latter and good nursing. "Me and that ass," he would say, "has been father and mother to him! Don\'t you," he would add, apostrophizing the helpless bundle before him, "never go back on us."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the time he was a month old the necessity of giving him a name became apparent. He had generally been known as "The Kid," "Stumpy\'s Boy," "The Coyote" (an allusion to his vocal powers), and even by Kentuck\'s endearing diminutive of "The damned little cuss." But these were felt to be vague and unsatisfactory, and were at last dismissed under another influence. Gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious, and Oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought "the luck" to Roaring Camp. It was certain that of late they had been successful. "Luck" was the name agreed upon, with the prefix of Tommy for greater convenience. No allusion was made to the mother, and the father was unknown. "It\'s better," said the philosophical Oakhurst, "to take a fresh deal all round. Call him Luck, and start him fair." A day was accordingly set apart for the christening. What was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine who has already gathered some idea of the reckless irreverence of Roaring Camp. The master of ceremonies was one "Boston," a noted wag, and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest facetiousness. This ingenious satirist had spent two days in preparing a burlesque of the Church service, with pointed local allusions. The choir was properly trained, and Sandy Tipton was to stand godfather. But after the procession had marched to the grove with music and banners, and the child had been deposited before a mock altar, Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd. "It ain\'t my style to spoil fun, boys," said the little man, stoutly eyeing the faces around him," but it strikes me that this thing ain\'t exactly on the squar. It\'s playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that he ain\'t goin\' to understand. And ef there\'s goin\' to be any godfathers round, I\'d like to see who\'s got any better rights than me." A silence followed Stumpy\'s speech. To the credit of all humorists be it said that the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped of his fun. "But," said Stumpy, quickly following up his advantage, "we\'re here for a christening, and we\'ll have it. I proclaim you Thomas Luck, according to the laws of the United States and the State of California, so help me God." It was the first time that the name of the Deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp. The form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had conceived; but strangely enough, nobody saw it and nobody laughed. "Tommy" was christened as seriously as he would have been under a Christian roof and cried and was comforted in as orthodox fashion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp. Almost imperceptibly a change came over the settlement. The cabin assigned to "Tommy Luck"--or "The Luck," as he was more frequently called--first showed signs of improvement. It was kept scrupulously clean and whitewashed. Then it was boarded, clothed, and papered. The rose wood cradle, packed eighty miles by mule, had, in Stumpy\'s way of putting it, "sorter killed the rest of the furniture." So the rehabilitation of the cabin became a necessity. The men who were in the habit of lounging in at Stumpy\'s to see "how \'The Luck\' got on" seemed to appreciate the change, and in self-defense the rival establishment of "Tuttle\'s grocery" bestirred itself and imported a carpet and mirrors. The reflections of the latter on the appearance of Roaring Camp tended to produce stricter habits of personal cleanliness. Again Stumpy imposed a kind of quarantine upon those who aspired to the honor and privilege of holding The Luck. It was a cruel mortification to Kentuck--who, in the carelessness of a large nature and the habits of frontier life, had begun to regard all garments as a second cuticle, which, like a snake\'s, only sloughed off through decay--to be debarred this privilege from certain prudential reasons. Yet such was the subtle influence of innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon in a clean shirt and face still shining from his ablutions. Nor were moral and social sanitary laws neglected. "Tommy," who was supposed to spend his whole existence in a persistent attempt to repose, must not be disturbed by noise. The shouting and yelling, which had gained the camp its infelicitous title, were not permitted within hearing distance of Stumpy\'s. The men conversed in whispers or smoked with Indian gravity. Profanity was tacitly given up in these sacred precincts, and throughout the camp a popular form of expletive, known as "D--n the luck!" and "Curse the luck!" was abandoned, as having a new personal bearing. Vocal music was not interdicted, being supposed to have a soothing, tranquilizing quality; and one song, sung by "Man-o\'-War Jack," an English sailor from her Majesty\'s Australian colonies, was quite popular as a lullaby. It was a lugubrious recital of the exploits of "the Arethusa, Seventy-four," in a muffled minor, ending with a prolonged dying fall at the burden of each verse, "On b-oo-o-ard of the Arethusa." It was a fine sight to see Jack holding The Luck, rocking from side to side as if with the motion of a ship, and crooning forth this naval ditty. Either through the peculiar rocking of Jack or the length of his song,--it contained ninety stanzas, and was continued with conscientious deliberation to the bitter end,--the lullaby generally had the desired effect. At such times the men would lie at full length under the trees in the soft summer twilight, smoking their pipes and drinking in the melodious utterances. An indistinct idea that this was pastoral happiness pervaded the camp. "This \'ere kind o\' think," said the Cockney Simmons, meditatively reclining on his elbow, "is \'evingly." It reminded him of Greenwich.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the long summer days The Luck was usually carried to the gulch from whence the golden store of Roaring Camp was taken. There, on a blanket spread over pine boughs, he would lie while the men were working in the ditches below. Latterly there was a rude attempt to decorate this bower with flowers and sweet-smelling shrubs, and generally some one would bring him a cluster of wild honeysuckles, azaleas, or the painted blossoms of Las Mariposas. The men had suddenly awakened to the fact that there were beauty and significance in these trifles, which they had so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet. A flake of glittering mica, a fragment of variegated quartz, a bright pebble from the bed of the creek, became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and strengthened, and were invariably pat aside for The Luck. It was wonderful how many treasures the woods and hillsides yielded that "would do for Tommy." Surrounded by playthings such as never child out of fairyland had before, it is to he hoped that Tommy was content. He appeared to be serenely happy, albeit there was an infantine gravity about him, a contemplative light in his round gray eyes, that sometimes worried Stumpy. He was always tractable and quiet, and it is recorded that once, having crept beyond his "corral,"--a hedge of tessellated pine boughs, which surrounded his bed,--he dropped over the bank on his head in the soft earth, and remained with his mottled legs in the air in that position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity. He was extricated without a murmur. I hesitate to record the many other instances of his sagacity, which rest, unfortunately, upon the statements of prejudiced friends. Some of them were not without a tinge of superstition. "I crep\' up the bank just now," said Kentuck one day, in a breathless state of excitement "and dern my skin if he was a-talking to a jay bird as was a-sittin\' on his lap. There they was, just as free and sociable as anything you please, a- jawin\' at each other just like two cherrybums." Howbeit, whether creeping over the pine boughs or lying lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him, to him the birds sang, the squirrels chattered, and the flowers bloomed. Nature was his nurse and playfellow. For him she would let slip between the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within his grasp; she would send wandering breezes to visit him with the balm of bay and resinous gum; to him the tall redwoods nodded familiarly and sleepily, the bumblebees buzzed, and the rooks cawed a slumbrous accompaniment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such was the golden summer of Roaring Camp. They were "flush times," and the luck was with them. The claims had yielded enormously. The camp was jealous of its privileges and looked suspiciously on strangers. No encouragement was given to immigration, and, to make their seclusion more perfect, the land on either side of the mountain wall that surrounded the camp they duly preempted. This, and a reputation for singular proficiency with the revolver, kept the reserve of Roaring Camp inviolate. The expressman--their only connecting link with the surrounding world-- sometimes told wonderful stories of the camp. He would say, "They\'ve a street up there in \'Roaring\' that would lay over any street in Red Dog. They\'ve got vines and flowers round their houses, and they wash themselves twice a day. But they\'re mighty rough on strangers, and they worship an Ingin baby."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the prosperity of the camp came a desire for further improvement. It was proposed to build a hotel in the following spring, and to invite one or two decent families to reside there for the sake of The Luck, who might perhaps profit by female companionship. The sacrifice that this concession to the sex cost these men, who were fiercely skeptical in regard to its general virtue and usefulness, can only be accounted for by their affection for Tommy. A few still held out. But the resolve could not be carried into effect for three months, and the minority meekly yielded in the hope that something might turn up to prevent it. And it did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The winter of 1851 will long be remembered in the foothills. The snow lay deep on the Sierras, and every mountain creek became a river, and every river a lake. Each gorge and gulch was transformed into a tumultuous watercourse that descended the hillsides, tearing down giant trees and scattering its drift and debris along the plain. Red Dog had been twice under water, and Roaring Camp had been forewarned. "Water put the gold into them gulches," said Stumpy. "It been here once and will be here again!" And that night the North Fork suddenly leaped over its banks and swept up the triangular valley of Roaring Camp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the confusion of rushing water, crashing trees, and crackling timber, and the darkness which seemed to flow with the water and blot out the fair valley, but little could be done to collect the scattered camp. When the morning broke, the cabin of Stumpy, nearest the river-bank, was gone. Higher up the gulch they found the body of its unlucky owner; but the pride, the hope, the joy, The Luck, of Roaring Camp had disappeared. They were returning with sad hearts when a shout from the bank recalled them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a relief-boat from down the river. They had picked up, they said, a man and an infant, nearly exhausted, about two miles below. Did anybody know them, and did they belong here?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It needed but a glance to show them Kentuck lying there, cruelly crushed and bruised, but still holding The Luck of Roaring Camp in his arms. As they bent over the strangely assorted pair, they saw that the child was cold and pulseless. "He is dead," said one. Kentuck opened his eyes. "Dead?" he repeated feebly. "Yes, my man, and you are dying too." A smile lit the eyes of the expiring Kentuck. "Dying!" he repeated; "he\'s a-taking me with him. Tell the boys I\'ve got The Luck with me now;" and the strong man, clinging to the frail babe as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw, drifted away into the shadowy river that flows forever to the unknown sea.</p>', 'The Luck of Roaring Camp', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-luck-of-roaring-camp', '', '', '2015-12-04 00:21:21', '2015-12-04 00:21:21', '', '0', 'http://test-tasks.local/primary/?p=35', '0', 'post', '', '0' );

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was commotion in Roaring Camp. It could not have been a fight, for in 1850 that was not novel enough to have called together the entire settlement. The ditches and claims were not only deserted, but "Tuttle\'s grocery" had contributed its gamblers, who, it will be remembered, calmly continued their game the day that French Pete and Kanaka Joe shot each other to death over the bar in the front room. The whole camp was collected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing. Conversation was carried on in a low tone, but the name of a woman was frequently repeated. It was a name familiar enough in the camp,--"Cherokee Sal."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the less said of her the better. She was a coarse and, it is to be feared, a very sinful woman. But at that time she was the only woman in Roaring Camp, and was just then lying in sore extremity, when she most needed the ministration of her own sex. Dissolute, abandoned, and irreclaimable, she was yet suffering a martyrdom hard enough to bear even when veiled by sympathizing womanhood, but now terrible in her loneliness. The primal curse had come to her in that original isolation which must have made the punishment of the first transgression so dreadful. It was, perhaps, part of the expiation of her sin that, at a moment when she most lacked her sex\'s intuitive tenderness and care, she met only the half-contemptuous faces of her masculine associates. Yet a few of the spectators were, I think, touched by her sufferings. Sandy Tipton thought it was "rough on Sal," and, in the contemplation of her condition, for a moment rose superior to the fact that he had an ace and two bowers in his sleeve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will be seen also that the situation was novel. Deaths were by no means uncommon in Roaring Camp, but a birth was a new thing. People had been dismissed the camp effectively, finally, and with no possibility of return; but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced AB INITIO. Hence the excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"You go in there, Stumpy," said a prominent citizen known as "Kentuck," addressing one of the loungers. "Go in there, and see what you kin do. You\'ve had experience in them things."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection. Stumpy, in other climes, had been the putative head of two families; in fact, it was owing to some legal informality in these proceedings that Roaring Camp--a city of refuge--was indebted to his company. The crowd approved the choice, and Stumpy was wise enough to bow to the majority. The door closed on the extempore surgeon and midwife, and Roaring Camp sat down outside, smoked its pipe, and awaited the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assemblage numbered about a hundred men. One or two of these were actual fugitives from justice, some were criminal, and all were reckless. Physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives and character. The greatest scamp had a Raphael face, with a profusion of blonde hair; Oakhurst, a gambler, had the melancholy air and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet; the coolest and most courageous man was scarcely over five feet in height, with a soft voice and an embarrassed, timid manner. The term "roughs" applied to them was a distinction rather than a definition. Perhaps in the minor details of fingers, toes, ears, etc., the camp may have been deficient, but these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force. The strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand; the best shot had but one eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed around the cabin. The camp lay in a triangular valley between two hills and a river. The only outlet was a steep trail over the summit of a hill that faced the cabin, now illuminated by the rising moon. The suffering woman might have seen it from the rude bunk whereon she lay,--seen it winding like a silver thread until it was lost in the stars above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gathering. By degrees the natural levity of Roaring Camp returned. Bets were freely offered and taken regarding the result. Three to five that "Sal would get through with it;" even that the child would survive; side bets as to the sex and complexion of the coming stranger. In the midst of an excited discussion an exclamation came from those nearest the door, and the camp stopped to listen. Above the swaying and moaning of the pines, the swift rush of the river, and the crackling of the fire rose a sharp, querulous cry,--a cry unlike anything heard before in the camp. The pines stopped moaning, the river ceased to rush, and the fire to crackle. It seemed as if Nature had stopped to listen too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The camp rose to its feet as one man! It was proposed to explode a barrel of gunpowder; but in consideration of the situation of the mother, better counsels prevailed, and only a few revolvers were discharged; for whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp, or some other reason, Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had climbed, as it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so passed out of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame, forever. I do not think that the announcement disturbed them much, except in speculation as to the fate of the child. "Can he live now?" was asked of Stumpy. The answer was doubtful. The only other being of Cherokee Sal\'s sex and maternal condition in the settlement was an ass. There was some conjecture as to fitness, but the experiment was tried. It was less problematical than the ancient treatment of Romulus and Remus, and apparently as successful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When these details were completed, which exhausted another hour, the door was opened, and the anxious crowd of men, who had already formed themselves into a queue, entered in single file. Beside the low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly outlined below the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a candle- box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp. Beside the candle-box was placed a hat. Its use was soon indicated. "Gentlemen," said Stumpy, with a singular mixture of authority and EX OFFICIO complacency,-- "gentlemen will please pass in at the front door, round the table, and out at the back door. Them as wishes to contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy." The first man entered with his hat on; he uncovered, however, as he looked about him, and so unconsciously set an example to the next. In such communities good and bad actions are catching. As the procession filed in comments were audible,--criticisms addressed perhaps rather to Stumpy in the character of showman; "Is that him?" "Mighty small specimen;" "Has n\'t more \'n got the color;" "Ain\'t bigger nor a derringer." The contributions were as characteristic: A silver tobacco box; a doubloon; a navy revolver, silver mounted; a gold specimen; a very beautifully embroidered lady\'s handkerchief (from Oakhurst the gambler); a diamond breastpin; a diamond ring (suggested by the pin, with the remark from the giver that he "saw that pin and went two diamonds better"); a slung-shot; a Bible (contributor not detected); a golden spur; a silver teaspoon (the initials, I regret to say, were not the giver\'s); a pair of surgeon\'s shears; a lancet; a Bank of England note for 5 pounds; and about $200 in loose gold and silver coin. During these proceedings Stumpy maintained a silence as impassive as the dead on his left, a gravity as inscrutable as that of the newly born on his right. Only one incident occurred to break the monotony of the curious procession. As Kentuck bent over the candle-box half curiously, the child turned, and, in a spasm of pain, caught at his groping finger, and held it fast for a moment. Kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed. Something like a blush tried to assert itself in his weather-beaten cheek. "The damned little cuss!" he said, as he extricated his finger, with perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed capable of showing. He held that finger a little apart from its fellows as he went out, and examined it curiously. The examination provoked the same original remark in regard to the child. In fact, he seemed to enjoy repeating it. "He rastled with my finger," he remarked to Tipton, holding up the member, "the damned little cuss!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was four o\'clock before the camp sought repose. A light burnt in the cabin where the watchers sat, for Stumpy did not go to bed that night. Nor did Kentuck. He drank quite freely, and related with great gusto his experience, invariably ending with his characteristic condemnation of the newcomer. It seemed to relieve him of any unjust implication of sentiment, and Kentuck had the weaknesses of the nobler sex. When everybody else had gone to bed, he walked down to the river and whistled reflectingly. Then he walked up the gulch past the cabin, still whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood-tree he paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin. Halfway down to the river\'s bank he again paused, and then returned and knocked at the door. It was opened by Stumpy. "How goes it?" said Kentuck, looking past Stumpy toward the candle-box. "All serene!" replied Stumpy. "Anything up?" "Nothing." There was a pause--an embarrassing one--Stumpy still holding the door. Then Kentuck had recourse to his finger, which he held up to Stumpy. "Rastled with it,--the damned little cuss," he said, and retired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next day Cherokee Sal had such rude sepulture as Roaring Camp afforded. After her body had been committed to the hillside, there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her infant. A resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic. But an animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at once sprang up. It was remarkable that the argument partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were usually conducted at Roaring Camp. Tipton proposed that they should send the child to Red Dog,--a distance of forty miles,--where female attention could be procured. But the unlucky suggestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition. It was evident that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained. "Besides," said Tom Ryder, "them fellows at Red Dog would swap it, and ring in somebody else on us." A disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed at Roaring Camp, as in other places.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with objection. It was argued that no decent woman could be prevailed to accept Roaring Camp as her home, and the speaker urged that "they didn\'t want any more of the other kind." This unkind allusion to the defunct mother, harsh as it may seem, was the first spasm of propriety,--the first symptom of the camp\'s regeneration. Stumpy advanced nothing. Perhaps he felt a certain delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible successor in office. But when questioned, he averred stoutly that he and "Jinny"--the mammal before alluded to--could manage to rear the child. There was something original, independent, and heroic about the plan that pleased the camp. Stumpy was retained. Certain articles were sent for to Sacramento. "Mind," said the treasurer, as he pressed a bag of gold-dust into the expressman\'s hand, "the best that can be got,--lace, you know, and filigree-work and frills,--damn the cost!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Strange to say, the child thrived. Perhaps the invigorating climate of the mountain camp was compensation for material deficiencies. Nature took the foundling to her broader breast. In that rare atmosphere of the Sierra foothills,--that air pungent with balsamic odor, that ethereal cordial at once bracing and exhilarating,--he may have found food and nourishment, or a subtle chemistry that transmuted ass\'s milk to lime and phosphorus. Stumpy inclined to the belief that it was the latter and good nursing. "Me and that ass," he would say, "has been father and mother to him! Don\'t you," he would add, apostrophizing the helpless bundle before him, "never go back on us."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the time he was a month old the necessity of giving him a name became apparent. He had generally been known as "The Kid," "Stumpy\'s Boy," "The Coyote" (an allusion to his vocal powers), and even by Kentuck\'s endearing diminutive of "The damned little cuss." But these were felt to be vague and unsatisfactory, and were at last dismissed under another influence. Gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious, and Oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought "the luck" to Roaring Camp. It was certain that of late they had been successful. "Luck" was the name agreed upon, with the prefix of Tommy for greater convenience. No allusion was made to the mother, and the father was unknown. "It\'s better," said the philosophical Oakhurst, "to take a fresh deal all round. Call him Luck, and start him fair." A day was accordingly set apart for the christening. What was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine who has already gathered some idea of the reckless irreverence of Roaring Camp. The master of ceremonies was one "Boston," a noted wag, and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest facetiousness. This ingenious satirist had spent two days in preparing a burlesque of the Church service, with pointed local allusions. The choir was properly trained, and Sandy Tipton was to stand godfather. But after the procession had marched to the grove with music and banners, and the child had been deposited before a mock altar, Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd. "It ain\'t my style to spoil fun, boys," said the little man, stoutly eyeing the faces around him," but it strikes me that this thing ain\'t exactly on the squar. It\'s playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that he ain\'t goin\' to understand. And ef there\'s goin\' to be any godfathers round, I\'d like to see who\'s got any better rights than me." A silence followed Stumpy\'s speech. To the credit of all humorists be it said that the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped of his fun. "But," said Stumpy, quickly following up his advantage, "we\'re here for a christening, and we\'ll have it. I proclaim you Thomas Luck, according to the laws of the United States and the State of California, so help me God." It was the first time that the name of the Deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp. The form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had conceived; but strangely enough, nobody saw it and nobody laughed. "Tommy" was christened as seriously as he would have been under a Christian roof and cried and was comforted in as orthodox fashion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp. Almost imperceptibly a change came over the settlement. The cabin assigned to "Tommy Luck"--or "The Luck," as he was more frequently called--first showed signs of improvement. It was kept scrupulously clean and whitewashed. Then it was boarded, clothed, and papered. The rose wood cradle, packed eighty miles by mule, had, in Stumpy\'s way of putting it, "sorter killed the rest of the furniture." So the rehabilitation of the cabin became a necessity. The men who were in the habit of lounging in at Stumpy\'s to see "how \'The Luck\' got on" seemed to appreciate the change, and in self-defense the rival establishment of "Tuttle\'s grocery" bestirred itself and imported a carpet and mirrors. The reflections of the latter on the appearance of Roaring Camp tended to produce stricter habits of personal cleanliness. Again Stumpy imposed a kind of quarantine upon those who aspired to the honor and privilege of holding The Luck. It was a cruel mortification to Kentuck--who, in the carelessness of a large nature and the habits of frontier life, had begun to regard all garments as a second cuticle, which, like a snake\'s, only sloughed off through decay--to be debarred this privilege from certain prudential reasons. Yet such was the subtle influence of innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon in a clean shirt and face still shining from his ablutions. Nor were moral and social sanitary laws neglected. "Tommy," who was supposed to spend his whole existence in a persistent attempt to repose, must not be disturbed by noise. The shouting and yelling, which had gained the camp its infelicitous title, were not permitted within hearing distance of Stumpy\'s. The men conversed in whispers or smoked with Indian gravity. Profanity was tacitly given up in these sacred precincts, and throughout the camp a popular form of expletive, known as "D--n the luck!" and "Curse the luck!" was abandoned, as having a new personal bearing. Vocal music was not interdicted, being supposed to have a soothing, tranquilizing quality; and one song, sung by "Man-o\'-War Jack," an English sailor from her Majesty\'s Australian colonies, was quite popular as a lullaby. It was a lugubrious recital of the exploits of "the Arethusa, Seventy-four," in a muffled minor, ending with a prolonged dying fall at the burden of each verse, "On b-oo-o-ard of the Arethusa." It was a fine sight to see Jack holding The Luck, rocking from side to side as if with the motion of a ship, and crooning forth this naval ditty. Either through the peculiar rocking of Jack or the length of his song,--it contained ninety stanzas, and was continued with conscientious deliberation to the bitter end,--the lullaby generally had the desired effect. At such times the men would lie at full length under the trees in the soft summer twilight, smoking their pipes and drinking in the melodious utterances. An indistinct idea that this was pastoral happiness pervaded the camp. "This \'ere kind o\' think," said the Cockney Simmons, meditatively reclining on his elbow, "is \'evingly." It reminded him of Greenwich.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the long summer days The Luck was usually carried to the gulch from whence the golden store of Roaring Camp was taken. There, on a blanket spread over pine boughs, he would lie while the men were working in the ditches below. Latterly there was a rude attempt to decorate this bower with flowers and sweet-smelling shrubs, and generally some one would bring him a cluster of wild honeysuckles, azaleas, or the painted blossoms of Las Mariposas. The men had suddenly awakened to the fact that there were beauty and significance in these trifles, which they had so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet. A flake of glittering mica, a fragment of variegated quartz, a bright pebble from the bed of the creek, became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and strengthened, and were invariably pat aside for The Luck. It was wonderful how many treasures the woods and hillsides yielded that "would do for Tommy." Surrounded by playthings such as never child out of fairyland had before, it is to he hoped that Tommy was content. He appeared to be serenely happy, albeit there was an infantine gravity about him, a contemplative light in his round gray eyes, that sometimes worried Stumpy. He was always tractable and quiet, and it is recorded that once, having crept beyond his "corral,"--a hedge of tessellated pine boughs, which surrounded his bed,--he dropped over the bank on his head in the soft earth, and remained with his mottled legs in the air in that position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity. He was extricated without a murmur. I hesitate to record the many other instances of his sagacity, which rest, unfortunately, upon the statements of prejudiced friends. Some of them were not without a tinge of superstition. "I crep\' up the bank just now," said Kentuck one day, in a breathless state of excitement "and dern my skin if he was a-talking to a jay bird as was a-sittin\' on his lap. There they was, just as free and sociable as anything you please, a- jawin\' at each other just like two cherrybums." Howbeit, whether creeping over the pine boughs or lying lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him, to him the birds sang, the squirrels chattered, and the flowers bloomed. Nature was his nurse and playfellow. For him she would let slip between the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within his grasp; she would send wandering breezes to visit him with the balm of bay and resinous gum; to him the tall redwoods nodded familiarly and sleepily, the bumblebees buzzed, and the rooks cawed a slumbrous accompaniment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such was the golden summer of Roaring Camp. They were "flush times," and the luck was with them. The claims had yielded enormously. The camp was jealous of its privileges and looked suspiciously on strangers. No encouragement was given to immigration, and, to make their seclusion more perfect, the land on either side of the mountain wall that surrounded the camp they duly preempted. This, and a reputation for singular proficiency with the revolver, kept the reserve of Roaring Camp inviolate. The expressman--their only connecting link with the surrounding world-- sometimes told wonderful stories of the camp. He would say, "They\'ve a street up there in \'Roaring\' that would lay over any street in Red Dog. They\'ve got vines and flowers round their houses, and they wash themselves twice a day. But they\'re mighty rough on strangers, and they worship an Ingin baby."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the prosperity of the camp came a desire for further improvement. It was proposed to build a hotel in the following spring, and to invite one or two decent families to reside there for the sake of The Luck, who might perhaps profit by female companionship. The sacrifice that this concession to the sex cost these men, who were fiercely skeptical in regard to its general virtue and usefulness, can only be accounted for by their affection for Tommy. A few still held out. But the resolve could not be carried into effect for three months, and the minority meekly yielded in the hope that something might turn up to prevent it. And it did.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired after my friend\'s friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that <i>Leonidas W</i>. Smiley is a myth; and that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his infamous <i>Jim Smiley</i>, and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel\'s, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up, and gave me good-day. I told him a friend had commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named <i>Leonidas W</i>. Smiley--<i>Rev. Leonidas W.</i> Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of Angel\'s Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in<i>finesse</i>. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Rev. Leonidas W. H\'m, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter of \'49--or may be it was the spring of \'50--I don\'t recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn\'t finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn\'t he\'d change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit <i>him</i>--any way just so\'s he got a bet, <i>he</i> was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn\'t be no solit\'ry thing mentioned but that feller\'d offer to bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you\'d find him flush or you\'d find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he\'d bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he\'d bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he\'d bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg\'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and he was, too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to--to wherever he <i>was</i> going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road.<img class="ssimg" src="http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-mare.jpg" alt="Thish-yer Smiley had a mare. An illustration for the great short story The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain" />Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i>--he\'d bet on <i>any</i> thing--the dangest feller. Parson Walker\'s wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn\'t going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf\'nit\' mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov\'dence she\'d get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, Well, I\'ll risk two-and-a-half she don\'t anyway.\'"

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she\'d get excited and desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-dog.jpg" alt="And he had a little small bull-pup.  An illustration for the great short story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain" />And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you\'d think he warn\'t worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a different dog; his under-jaw\'d begin to stick out like the fo\'-castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let on but what <i>he</i> was satisfied, and hadn\'t expected nothing else--and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j\'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--not chaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn\'t have no hind legs, because they\'d been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he\'d been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he \'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn\'t try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He gave Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn\'t no hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he\'d lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it, because he hadn\'t no opportunities to speak of, and it don\'t stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he hadn\'t no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his\'n, and the way it turned out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats and all of them kind of things, till you couldn\'t rest, and you couldn\'t fetch nothing for him to bet on but he\'d match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal\'lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He\'d give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you\'d see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat.</p>

<center><img src="http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-summerset.jpg" alt="An illustration of a frog summersetting for the great short story The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain" /></center>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep\' him in practice so constant, that he\'d nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do \'most anything--and I believe him. Why, I\'ve seen him set Dan\'l Webster down here on this floor--Dan\'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing out, "Flies, Dan\'l, flies!" and quicker\'n you could wink he\'d spring straight up and snake a fly off\'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag\'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn\'t no idea he\'d been doin\' any more\'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor\'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-daniel-webster-400x653.jpg" alt="Smiley kep\' the beast in a little lattice box.  An illustration for the great short story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain" />Well, Smiley kep\' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller--a stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"What might be that you\'ve got in the box?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, maybe, but it ain\'t--it\'s only just a frog."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and says, "H\'m--so \'tis. Well, what\'s <i>he</i> good for?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "he\'s good enough for <i>one</i> thing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "I don\'t see no p\'ints about that frog that\'s any better\'n any other frog."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Maybe you don\'t," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs and maybe you don\'t understand \'em; maybe you\'ve had experience, and maybe you ain\'t only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I\'ve got <i>my</i> opinion and I\'ll risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like, "Well, I\'m only a stranger here, and I ain\'t got no frog; but if I had a frog, I\'d bet you."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then Smiley says, "That\'s all right--that\'s all right--if you\'ll hold my box a minute, I\'ll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley\'s, and set down to wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to his-self, and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot--filled! him pretty near up to his chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Now, if you\'re ready, set him alongside of Dan\'l, with his forepaws just even with Dan\'l\'s, and I\'ll give the word." Then he says, "One--two--three--<i>git</i>!" and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan\'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but it warn\'t no use--he couldn\'t budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn\'t no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn\'t have no idea what the matter was, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan\'l, and says again, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "<i>I</i> don\'t see no p\'ints about that frog that\'s any better\'n any other frog."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="ssimg" src="http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-upside-down.jpg" alt="An illustration for the great short story The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain" />Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan\'l a long time, and at last says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throwed off for--I wonder if there ain\'t something the matter with him--he \'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow." And he ketched Dan\'l up by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, "Why blame my cats if he don\'t weigh five pounds!" and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And----

<p style="text-align: justify;">(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain\'t going to be gone a second."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond <i>Jim</i> Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. <i>Leonidas W.</i> Smiley, and so I started away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn\'t have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and----"</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to his-self, and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot--filled! him pretty near up to his chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Now, if you\'re ready, set him alongside of Dan\'l, with his forepaws just even with Dan\'l\'s, and I\'ll give the word." Then he says, "One--two--three--<i>git</i>!" and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan\'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but it warn\'t no use--he couldn\'t budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn\'t no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn\'t have no idea what the matter was, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan\'l, and says again, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "<i>I</i> don\'t see no p\'ints about that frog that\'s any better\'n any other frog."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="ssimg" src="http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-upside-down.jpg" alt="An illustration for the great short story The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain" />Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan\'l a long time, and at last says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throwed off for--I wonder if there ain\'t something the matter with him--he \'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow." And he ketched Dan\'l up by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, "Why blame my cats if he don\'t weigh five pounds!" and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And----

<p style="text-align: justify;">(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain\'t going to be gone a second."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond <i>Jim</i> Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. <i>Leonidas W.</i> Smiley, and so I started away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn\'t have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and----"</p>

TRUE!-NERVOUS--very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses--not destroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--how calmly I can tell you the whole story.

It is impossible to tell how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture--a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.

Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded--with what caution--with what foresight--with what dissimulation I went to work!

I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it--oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly--very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man\'s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!--would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously--oh, so cautiously--cautiously (for the hinges creaked)--I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights--every night just at midnight--but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.

Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch\'s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers--of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back--but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.

I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out: "Who\'s there?"

I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.

Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or grief--oh no!--it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself: "It is nothing but the wind in the chimney--it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him. had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel--although he neither saw nor heard--to feel the presence of my head within the room.

When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little--a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it--you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily--until, at length, a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and full upon the vulture eye.

It was open--wide, wide open--and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness--all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man\'s face or person: for I had directed the ray, as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.

And now--have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well too. It was the beating of the old man\'s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.

But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker\' and louder and louder every instant. The old man\'s terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!--do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me--the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man\'s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once--once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.

If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.

I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out--no stain of any kind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all--ha! ha!

When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o\'clock--still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart--for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night: suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.

I smiled--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search--search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.

The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:--it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness--until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.

No doubt I now grew very pale,--but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased--and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound--much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath--and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly--more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observation of the men--but the noise steadily increased. Oh, God; what could I do? I foamed--I raved--I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder--louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!--no, no! They heard!--they suspected--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my horror!--this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!--and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder!

They said TMT would be a desecration but never had the chance to prove it. That could soon change as the Hawaii Supreme Court says the State Land Board violated the people\'s rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"In short, BLNR acted improperly when it issued the permit prior to holding a contested case hearing. No case or argument put forth by UHH or BLNR persuades otherwise," stated the Supreme Court opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ruling means the issue must head back to where it stood four years ago, in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"My clients and I are ready to move forward in a new process. It\'s going to take years to come to make its way through the different levels of litigation," said Richard Naiwi Wurdeman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the ruling, Wurdeman had a strong message for Governor David Ige.</p>
"He owes the people an apology for violating their civil liberties. He owes the Hawaiians an apology, the general community an apology, and I hope all those charges that are pending against the protectors will be dropped because really it was all based on false premises," said Wurdeman.
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following statement is from Henry Yang, Chair of the TMT International Observatory Board of Directors, regarding Wednesday\'s ruling:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We thank the Hawaii Supreme Court for the timely ruling and we respect their decision. TMT will follow the process set forth by the state, as we always have. We are assessing our next steps on the way forward. We appreciate and thank the people of Hawaii and our supporters from these last eight-plus years."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next move would likely be a hearing in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Today\'s decision provides direction to a new Land Board and another opportunity for people to discuss Mauna Kea\'s future. The Attorney General\'s office will be advising the Land Board regarding next steps," said State Attorney General Douglas Chin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of Hawaii weighed in as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The University of Hawaii continues to believe that Mauna Kea is a precious resource where science and culture can synergistically coexist now and into the future, and remains strongly in support of the Thirty Meter Telescope. UH is currently reviewing the court\'s decision to determine the best path forward," said Dan Meisenzahl, a UH spokesperson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If TMT is to go forward with its project, it would have to go through the permitting process once again. Attorney Richard Wurdeman believes the Supreme Courts Decision could put construction on hold for several years. It\'s been on hold since April.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The ruling means the issue must head back to where it stood four years ago, in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"My clients and I are ready to move forward in a new process. It\'s going to take years to come to make its way through the different levels of litigation," said Richard Naiwi Wurdeman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the ruling, Wurdeman had a strong message for Governor David Ige.</p>
"He owes the people an apology for violating their civil liberties. He owes the Hawaiians an apology, the general community an apology, and I hope all those charges that are pending against the protectors will be dropped because really it was all based on false premises," said Wurdeman.
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following statement is from Henry Yang, Chair of the TMT International Observatory Board of Directors, regarding Wednesday\'s ruling:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We thank the Hawaii Supreme Court for the timely ruling and we respect their decision. TMT will follow the process set forth by the state, as we always have. We are assessing our next steps on the way forward. We appreciate and thank the people of Hawaii and our supporters from these last eight-plus years."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next move would likely be a hearing in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Today\'s decision provides direction to a new Land Board and another opportunity for people to discuss Mauna Kea\'s future. The Attorney General\'s office will be advising the Land Board regarding next steps," said State Attorney General Douglas Chin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of Hawaii weighed in as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The University of Hawaii continues to believe that Mauna Kea is a precious resource where science and culture can synergistically coexist now and into the future, and remains strongly in support of the Thirty Meter Telescope. UH is currently reviewing the court\'s decision to determine the best path forward," said Dan Meisenzahl, a UH spokesperson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If TMT is to go forward with its project, it would have to go through the permitting process once again. Attorney Richard Wurdeman believes the Supreme Courts Decision could put construction on hold for several years. It\'s been on hold since April.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following statement is from Henry Yang, Chair of the TMT International Observatory Board of Directors, regarding Wednesday\'s ruling:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We thank the Hawaii Supreme Court for the timely ruling and we respect their decision. TMT will follow the process set forth by the state, as we always have. We are assessing our next steps on the way forward. We appreciate and thank the people of Hawaii and our supporters from these last eight-plus years."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next move would likely be a hearing in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Today\'s decision provides direction to a new Land Board and another opportunity for people to discuss Mauna Kea\'s future. The Attorney General\'s office will be advising the Land Board regarding next steps," said State Attorney General Douglas Chin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of Hawaii weighed in as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The University of Hawaii continues to believe that Mauna Kea is a precious resource where science and culture can synergistically coexist now and into the future, and remains strongly in support of the Thirty Meter Telescope. UH is currently reviewing the court\'s decision to determine the best path forward," said Dan Meisenzahl, a UH spokesperson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If TMT is to go forward with its project, it would have to go through the permitting process once again. Attorney Richard Wurdeman believes the Supreme Courts Decision could put construction on hold for several years. It\'s been on hold since April.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At 13,796 feet high, the summit of Mauna Kea is a prime place for astronomy, but to some Native Hawaiians, it\'s a place that is sacred.

<p style="text-align: justify;">"In short, BLNR acted improperly when it issued the permit prior to holding a contested case hearing. No case or argument put forth by UHH or BLNR persuades otherwise," stated the Supreme Court opinion.</p>

On Wednesday, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled the permit to construct the telescope on Mauna Kea is invalid. TMT opponents are calling this their most important victory yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At 13,796 feet high, the summit of Mauna Kea is a prime place for astronomy, but to some Native Hawaiians, it\'s a place that is sacred. Back in 2011 when they found out the Board of Land and Natural Resources approved a permit so a Thirty Meter Telescope could be built on the mountain, they requested to challenge the decision. They said TMT would be a desecration but never had the chance to prove it. That could soon change as the Hawaii Supreme Court says the State Land Board violated the people\'s rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"In short, BLNR acted improperly when it issued the permit prior to holding a contested case hearing. No case or argument put forth by UHH or BLNR persuades otherwise," stated the Supreme Court opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ruling means the issue must head back to where it stood four years ago, in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"My clients and I are ready to move forward in a new process. It\'s going to take years to come to make its way through the different levels of litigation," said Richard Naiwi Wurdeman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the ruling, Wurdeman had a strong message for Governor David Ige.</p>
"He owes the people an apology for violating their civil liberties. He owes the Hawaiians an apology, the general community an apology, and I hope all those charges that are pending against the protectors will be dropped because really it was all based on false premises," said Wurdeman.

On Wednesday, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled the permit to construct the telescope on Mauna Kea is invalid. TMT opponents are calling this their most important victory yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At 13,796 feet high, the summit of Mauna Kea is a prime place for astronomy, but to some Native Hawaiians, it\'s a place that is sacred. Back in 2011 when they found out the Board of Land and Natural Resources approved a permit so a Thirty Meter Telescope could be built on the mountain, they requested to challenge the decision. They said TMT would be a desecration but never had the chance to prove it. That could soon change as the Hawaii Supreme Court says the State Land Board violated the people\'s rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"In short, BLNR acted improperly when it issued the permit prior to holding a contested case hearing. No case or argument put forth by UHH or BLNR persuades otherwise," stated the Supreme Court opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ruling means the issue must head back to where it stood four years ago, in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"My clients and I are ready to move forward in a new process. It\'s going to take years to come to make its way through the different levels of litigation," said Richard Naiwi Wurdeman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the ruling, Wurdeman had a strong message for Governor David Ige.</p>
"He owes the people an apology for violating their civil liberties. He owes the Hawaiians an apology, the general community an apology, and I hope all those charges that are pending against the protectors will be dropped because really it was all based on false premises," said Wurdeman.
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following statement is from Henry Yang, Chair of the TMT International Observatory Board of Directors, regarding Wednesday\'s ruling:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We thank the Hawaii Supreme Court for the timely ruling and we respect their decision.

On Wednesday, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled the permit to construct the telescope on Mauna Kea is invalid. TMT opponents are calling this their most important victory yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At 13,796 feet high, the summit of Mauna Kea is a prime place for astronomy, but to some Native Hawaiians, it\'s a place that is sacred. Back in 2011 when they found out the Board of Land and Natural Resources approved a permit so a Thirty Meter Telescope could be built on the mountain, they requested to challenge the decision. They said TMT would be a desecration but never had the chance to prove it. That could soon change as the Hawaii Supreme Court says the State Land Board violated the people\'s rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"In short, BLNR acted improperly when it issued the permit prior to holding a contested case hearing. No case or argument put forth by UHH or BLNR persuades otherwise," stated the Supreme Court opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ruling means the issue must head back to where it stood four years ago, in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"My clients and I are ready to move forward in a new process. It\'s going to take years to come to make its way through the different levels of litigation," said Richard Naiwi Wurdeman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the ruling, Wurdeman had a strong message for Governor David Ige.</p>
"He owes the people an apology for violating their civil liberties. He owes the Hawaiians an apology, the general community an apology, and I hope all those charges that are pending against the protectors will be dropped because really it was all based on false premises," said Wurdeman.
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following statement is from Henry Yang, Chair of the TMT International Observatory Board of Directors, regarding Wednesday\'s ruling:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We thank the Hawaii Supreme Court for the timely ruling and we respect their decision. TMT will follow the process set forth by the state, as we always have. We are assessing our next steps on the way forward. We appreciate and thank the people of Hawaii and our supporters from these last eight-plus years."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next move would likely be a hearing in front of the BLNR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Today\'s decision provides direction to a new Land Board and another opportunity for people to discuss Mauna Kea\'s future. The Attorney General\'s office will be advising the Land Board regarding next steps," said State Attorney General Douglas Chin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of Hawaii weighed in as well.</p>
